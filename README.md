# 🌀 Problem-Driven AI
> **"The answer is 42. The problem is that we never knew what the question was."**

In the era of Artificial Intelligence, building is faster and cheaper than ever. But speed is not progress if you are running in the wrong direction. **Problem-Driven AI** is a thinking methodology designed to ensure that the superpower of AI is applied to solving real problems, not accelerating incorrect solutions.

## 💡 The Philosophy
The bottleneck of technology has never been construction—it has always been **understanding**.

* **Thought is the Product:** Construction costs are trending toward zero. Competitive advantage now lies in the depth of our questions and the clarity of our thinking.
* **Context over Code:** A poorly defined problem fed into an AI produces a perfectly constructed incorrect answer at scale. The quality of the output is a direct function of the quality of the context provided.
* **Aim Before You Fire:** This isn't about going slower; it's about earning the right to build through the deeply human work of listening, aligning, and defining.

## 🚀 The Continuous Value Loop (The Spiral)
The methodology operates in a spiral of five phases that transform uncertainty into high-precision solutions:

1.  **Problem Phase:** Deep research to find the real problem, not just the one that is comfortable to solve.
2.  **Solution Phase:** Achieving genuine organizational consensus on the solution before writing a single line of context.
3.  **Context Phase:** The high-leverage skill of the AI era. Systematically translating human thought into a structured system of **Agents and Documents** that AI can process with fidelity.
4.  **AI Build Phase:** Context-guided construction. With high-quality context, this phase becomes the point of lowest friction.
5.  **Market Phase:** Real-world usage generates signals that feed back into the system, making every turn of the spiral smarter than the last.

## 🛠️ Execution: Context Engineering
To ensure AI executes without "context loss," we transform strategy into **Artifacts of Truth**:

* **Specialized Agents:** Roles (Analyst, PM, Architect) that act as context executors to maintain coherence.
* **Structured Artifacts:** From the **PRD** (defining the *what* and *for whom*) to the **project-context.md** (the "Constitution" of the project), ensuring global rules remain consistent.
