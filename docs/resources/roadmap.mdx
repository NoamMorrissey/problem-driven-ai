Problem-Driven AI follows a **versioned release model** — like a product, not a static document. Each release brings new content, practical tools, and improvements based on real-world feedback.

**Current version: Beta 0.1**

---

## Versioning model

We use **semantic versioning** with themed milestones:

- **PATCH (0.1.x):** Fixes, corrections, minor adjustments
- **MINOR (0.x.0):** New features, sections, tools
- **MAJOR:** 1.0 = stable release, 2.0 = ecosystem

---

## Beta 0.1 — *Foundation*

> **Status: Current**

The initial release. Five complete phases across two layers (methodology + framework), 10 principles, FAQ, and glossary — all fully bilingual (EN/ES).

**What's included:**
- 5 methodology phases with conceptual depth
- 5 framework phases with step-by-step processes, artifact anatomy, gate reviews, anti-patterns, and effort estimates
- 10 foundational principles
- Manifesto and overview
- FAQ and glossary

---

## Beta 0.2 — *Content Complete*

> **Status: Planned**

Close all content gaps. Every phase reaches uniform depth with no theoretical holes.

**Planned deliverables:**
- New methodology pages to fill identified gaps across phases
- Framework corrections and numbering consistency
- Principles relationship map — a visual system showing how the 10 principles interconnect
- Complete documentation for all referenced artifacts

---

## Beta 0.3 — *Toolkit*

> **Status: Planned**

Transform artifact documentation into **downloadable, usable templates**. The methodology becomes something you can apply, not just read.

**Planned deliverables:**
- ~20 downloadable templates covering all 5 phases
- Format matched to artifact type: Markdown for structured documents, Google Sheets for tabular registers, visual guides for board-based artifacts
- Templates section in Resources with download functionality
- Each template linked from its corresponding artifact page

---

## Beta 0.4 — *Experience*

> **Status: Planned**

A complete onboarding experience. Someone new can enter the site and apply the methodology end-to-end.

**Planned deliverables:**
- **Quick Start tutorial** — a guided, step-by-step walkthrough: "Apply Problem-Driven AI to your first project"
- **End-to-end case study** — a real (anonymized) project that traverses all 5 phases, showing artifacts produced and lessons learned

---

## Beta 0.5 — *Polish*

> **Status: Planned**

Professional-grade site quality. UX, SEO, and navigation refinements.

**Planned deliverables:**
- Navigation and cross-linking improvements between methodology and framework layers
- Interactive principles relationship map
- SEO and metadata optimization
- Complete changelog history

---

## RC 1.0 — *Release Candidate*

> **Status: Planned**

External validation before stable release. Beta testers apply the methodology and provide structured feedback.

**Exit criteria:**
- Zero known navigation/redirect bugs
- At least one beta tester completes the Quick Start successfully
- All feedback integrated or documented as backlog

---

## 1.0 — *Stable*

> **Status: Planned**

The official public release. The methodology is complete, usable, and validated.

**What "1.0" means:**
- Complete content: 5 phases with uniform depth + 10 principles + operational framework
- Practical tools: ~20 downloadable templates
- Onboarding: Quick Start tutorial + real case study
- Quality: professional, navigable, fully bilingual site
