Problem-Driven AI follows a **versioned release model** — like a product, not a static document. Each release brings new content, practical tools, and improvements based on real-world feedback.

We use **semantic versioning** with themed milestones: patches for fixes, minors for new features, and majors for milestone releases (1.0 = stable, 2.0 = ecosystem).

**Current version: Beta 0.1**

<RoadmapTimeline>

<RoadmapItem version="Beta 0.1" title="Foundation" status="current">

The initial release. Five complete phases across two layers (methodology + framework), 10 principles, FAQ, and glossary — all fully bilingual (EN/ES).

- 5 methodology phases with conceptual depth
- 5 framework phases with step-by-step processes, artifact anatomy, gate reviews, anti-patterns, and effort estimates
- 10 foundational principles
- Manifesto and overview
- FAQ and glossary

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="Beta 0.2" title="Content Complete" status="planned">

Close all content gaps. Every phase reaches uniform depth with no theoretical holes.

- New methodology pages to fill identified gaps across phases
- Framework corrections and numbering consistency
- Principles relationship map — a visual system showing how the 10 principles interconnect
- Complete documentation for all referenced artifacts

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="Beta 0.3" title="Toolkit" status="planned">

Transform artifact documentation into **downloadable, usable templates**. The methodology becomes something you can apply, not just read.

- ~20 downloadable templates covering all 5 phases
- Format matched to artifact type: Markdown for structured documents, Google Sheets for tabular registers, visual guides for board-based artifacts
- Templates section in Resources with download functionality
- Each template linked from its corresponding artifact page

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="Beta 0.4" title="Experience" status="planned">

A complete onboarding experience. Someone new can enter the site and apply the methodology end-to-end.

- **Quick Start tutorial** — a guided, step-by-step walkthrough: "Apply Problem-Driven AI to your first project"
- **End-to-end case study** — a real (anonymized) project that traverses all 5 phases, showing artifacts produced and lessons learned

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="Beta 0.5" title="Polish" status="planned">

Professional-grade site quality. UX, SEO, and navigation refinements.

- Navigation and cross-linking improvements between methodology and framework layers
- Interactive principles relationship map
- SEO and metadata optimization
- Complete changelog history

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="RC 1.0" title="Release Candidate" status="planned">

External validation before stable release. Beta testers apply the methodology and provide structured feedback.

- Zero known navigation/redirect bugs
- At least one beta tester completes the Quick Start successfully
- All feedback integrated or documented as backlog

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="1.0" title="Stable" status="planned">

The official public release. The methodology is complete, usable, and validated.

- Complete content: 5 phases with uniform depth + 10 principles + operational framework
- Practical tools: ~20 downloadable templates
- Onboarding: Quick Start tutorial + real case study
- Quality: professional, navigable, fully bilingual site

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="1.x" title="Operations" status="future">

The organizational layer: how teams operate using the methodology.

- Operating model — roles, team structure, responsibilities
- Formalized processes and workflows between phases
- Team ceremonies — kickoffs, reviews, retrospectives
- Metrics — what to measure, how to collect, KPIs per phase
- Center of Excellence around problem analysis and context building
- Dashboards for data collection and decision-making

</RoadmapItem>

<RoadmapItem version="2.0" title="Ecosystem" status="future">

The full ecosystem around the methodology.

- <a href="https://docs.bmad-method.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMAD</a> module — extension adapted to Problem-Driven AI
- Community — Discord/GitHub Discussions, external contributions
- Multiple case studies — library of real cases from different industries
- Certification — training and certification in the methodology
