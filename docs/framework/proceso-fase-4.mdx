# Build Validation and System Integration

Parallel track execution, technical collision supervision, and final fidelity validation. The critical step before massive deployment.

## Technical execution and fidelity map

Parallel track management, collision detection, and stakeholder validation.

## Decision classification

Impact of unforeseen decisions made during track construction.

<WeightChart bars={[
  {label: 'Local decisions', percent: 65, color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary-lightest)'},
  {label: 'Cross-track decisions', percent: 25, color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary-light)'},
  {label: 'Global decisions', percent: 10, color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
]} />

Local decisions stay within a single track. Cross-track decisions affect interface contracts between tracks. Global decisions modify Rules in project-context.md and force all Agents to reload updated context.

## Gap distribution

Categorization of blocking failures detected by the QA Agent during integration.

<EffortChart segments={[
  {label: 'Specification', percent: 40, color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
  {label: 'Rules', percent: 30, color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
  {label: 'Data', percent: 20, color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
  {label: 'Architecture', percent: 10, color: 'var(--ifm-color-info)'},
]} />

- **Specification gaps** — The Agent cannot complete the Skill without ambiguity. If it affects a shared contract, all tracks using it must stop.
- **Rules gaps** — Skills in different tracks produce inconsistencies invisible until integration. New Rule required; all Agents reload.
- **Data gaps** — Data not available in the expected format or quality. If shared, all consuming tracks must stop.
- **Architecture gaps** — An architecture decision is unfeasible. Full stop. Return to Phase 3.

## Build fidelity triple check

Recognition level of the Build by the stakeholders responsible for each phase.

<RadarChart
  axes={['Problem fidelity (F1)', 'Solution fidelity (F2)', 'Integration coherence', 'PRD use cases', 'Context Rules']}
  datasets={[
    {label: 'Current recognition', values: [90, 95, 88, 100, 92], color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
    {label: 'Critical threshold', values: [80, 80, 80, 80, 80], color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
  ]}
/>

- **Problem fidelity (F1)** — Phase 1 stakeholders recognize the system as a response to the problem they described.
- **Solution fidelity (F2)** — Phase 2 stakeholders recognize the system as the solution they approved.
- **Integration coherence** — Outputs from all tracks are compatible and the integrated system works.
- **PRD use cases** — End-to-end execution of all PRD use cases without collisions.
- **Context Rules** — No Decision Log entries contradict the Problem Statement without documented justification.

## The six artifacts

1. **Verified Environment** — Aligned team, verified dependency graph, operational distributed Decision Log. Produced during setup.
2. **Completed Skills** — All Story Files executed by Agents and validated by the QA Agent against acceptance criteria and global Rules.
3. **Updated Decision Log** — Consolidated registry from all tracks with cross-impact classification. Every unforeseen decision documented with its scope.
4. **Build Validation Report** — Signed by the Tech Lead and Phase 1-2 stakeholders after the fidelity review passes all four blocks.
5. **Updated Context Document** — Rules that emerged during construction incorporated into project-context.md. Dependency graph updated.
6. **Iteration Brief** — Cross-track learnings, open hypotheses for Phase 5, and assumptions to validate with market data.

:::caution[Gate Review: 10 closure conditions]
- ✅ **Briefing:** Team answers the 5 key questions after context delivery.
- ✅ **Graph:** Implicit dependencies documented and verified by all Dev Leads.
- ✅ **Gaps:** All QA-detected gaps resolved with documented classification.
- ✅ **Sync:** Integration synchronization minutes signed by all tracks.
- ✅ **Use cases:** Full PRD execution end-to-end without failures.
- ✅ **F1 check:** Phase 1 stakeholders recognize the system as a faithful response to the problem.
- ✅ **F2 check:** Phase 2 stakeholders recognize the system as the approved solution.
- ✅ **Decision Log:** No decision contradicts the Problem Statement without documented justification.
- ✅ **Context:** Emergent Rules consolidated into project-context.md.
- ✅ **Brief:** Iteration Brief drafted with cross-track learnings and ready for Phase 5 transfer.
- ❌ No advancement if Block 0 (integration coherence) is not approved.
- ❌ No advancement if cross-track or global Decision Log entries lack resolution status.
- ❌ No advancement if the Build Validation Report is unsigned by Phase 1-2 stakeholders.

:::tip[Build Validation complete]
Build Validation Report signed and transferred. The system is recognized as a faithful expression of the Problem Statement and Solution Brief. Phase 5 (Market Phase) begins with the updated Context Document, the consolidated Decision Log, and the Iteration Brief as its foundation.
