Context Phase can fail in predictable ways. Knowing these patterns in advance allows the team to detect them early and correct course before the damage compounds. The [methodology section](/phases/context-phase) already describes the conceptual-level anti-patterns (the Context-Prompt, Implicit Rules, the Creative Agent, Agents Without Borders, the Orphaned Skill). This section covers the **operational anti-patterns** that emerge during the execution of the framework process.

<AntiPatternAccordion>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={1} title="Over-Context">
    **What it is:** Rules so detailed and Skills so prescriptive that Agents have no space to solve problems. Every decision is pre-made. Every implementation detail is specified. The context system becomes a step-by-step recipe that leaves zero room for intelligence.

    **What it looks like in practice:**
    - The project-context.md exceeds 10 pages.
    - Skills include pseudocode or implementation details instead of objectives and acceptance criteria.
    - Level 4-5 Rules are used for decisions that should be Level 1-2.
    - Agents produce output that is technically correct but mechanically rigid — functional but unintelligent.

    **Why it's dangerous:** The output follows Rules to the letter but produces code that no experienced developer would write. It's the equivalent of micromanaging a senior engineer: you get compliance, not craftsmanship. The Agents stop thinking and start copying.

    **How to detect it:** If the output of a Skill reads like it was generated by filling in a template — all the right pieces but no engineering judgment — you're over-specifying.

    **How to prevent it:** Levels 1-2 exist for a reason. Use them. Skills define the "what," not the "how." If a Skill includes pseudocode, you're probably over-specifying. Trust that a well-defined Agent with clear Rules can make implementation decisions.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={2} title="The Silent Agent">
    **What it is:** An Agent that detects a gap in a Skill — missing information, ambiguous requirement, unclear constraint — and fills it with invention instead of signaling it. The Agent produces output that looks complete and confident, but contains decisions that nobody authorized.

    **What it looks like in practice:**
    - Outputs include features or behaviors not mentioned in the Skill.
    - Implementation choices are made without tracing to Rules or Skill constraints.
    - The QA Agent finds outputs that are internally consistent but don't match the PRD.
    - The team discovers "phantom features" during review — things nobody asked for.

    **Why it's dangerous:** Context drift. The project silently diverges from the Problem Statement and the Solution Brief. By the time someone notices, dozens of Skills have been executed based on unauthorized assumptions. The cost of correction is enormous.

    **How to detect it:** Compare outputs against Skill acceptance criteria. If the output contains elements not covered by the criteria, an Agent filled a gap silently.

    **How to prevent it:** The gap protocol must be in every Agent's definition AND in the project-context.md as a Level 5 Rule. The Rule is simple: "When information is insufficient, stop, document, and flag. Never invent." This is the single most important Rule in the entire system.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={3} title="Aspirational Context">
    **What it is:** Rules that describe the ideal project instead of the real one. Skills that ignore the constraints from the Solution Brief. The context system paints a picture of what the team wishes they were building rather than what they agreed to build.

    **What it looks like in practice:**
    - Rules specify best-in-class practices that exceed the project's constraints (budget, time, team capacity).
    - Skills assume resources or capabilities that don't exist.
    - The gap between the context system and reality widens as construction progresses.
    - Agents produce outputs that are elegant but inviable.

    **Why it's dangerous:** The Agents execute faithfully — that's what they do. If the Rules and Skills describe a fantasy, the Agents will build the fantasy. And the fantasy won't work when it meets reality.

    **How to detect it:** Compare every Rule and every Skill against the constraints in the Solution Brief. If any constraint has been softened, ignored, or "aspirationally improved," the context is aspirational.

    **How to prevent it:** The constraints from the Solution Brief are copied literally into the Rules. Skills inherit those Rules. No Agent can ignore them. The Solution Brief is the reality contract — the context system must honor it.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={4} title="The Broken Chain">
    **What it is:** A link in the Agent chain produces output without QA validation. The next Agent consumes unverified output and generates Rules or Skills based on potentially flawed input. Errors propagate and amplify.

    **What it looks like in practice:**
    - The PM Agent produces the PRD, and the Architect Agent starts working on it before QA validates it.
    - An error in the PRD (a missing constraint, an incorrect assumption) gets amplified: the Architect makes decisions based on it, the SM Agent decomposes Skills based on those decisions, and development Agents execute Skills based on all of it.
    - By the time the error is discovered, it has contaminated dozens of downstream artifacts.

    **Why it's dangerous:** Error amplification. A small error at the PRD level multiplies at each link of the chain. A single missing constraint can produce dozens of incorrectly specified Skills.

    **How to detect it:** If any Agent's output was consumed without QA validation, the chain has a weak link. Check: does every artifact in the chain have a corresponding QA validation entry?

    **How to prevent it:** The QA Agent validates the output of every Agent before it passes to the next. Every link in the chain has a fidelity, completeness, and consistency checkpoint. No output moves forward without validation.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={5} title="Frozen Context">
    **What it is:** Rules, Agents, and Skills that are never updated after their initial creation. Construction reveals that an assumption was wrong, but instead of updating the Rules, an Agent makes a local decision within a Skill. The context system gradually becomes disconnected from reality.

    **What it looks like in practice:**
    - Construction reveals that a Rule is too restrictive or too loose, but no one updates it.
    - Agents make "practical exceptions" to Rules during Skill execution without documenting them.
    - New Skills are written to work around known gaps in the Rules instead of fixing the Rules.
    - The Decision Log is empty or stale.

    **Why it's dangerous:** Context Debt. The Rules no longer reflect reality. New Skills are based on outdated Rules. Old Skills that worked correctly may break when new Rules should have been applied. The gap between the documented context and the actual context grows silently.

    **How to detect it:** Check the Decision Log. If it hasn't been updated in the last sprint, the context is probably frozen. Ask the team: "Has anything been decided during construction that isn't reflected in the project-context.md?" If the answer is yes, the context is frozen.

    **How to prevent it:** Every decision that differs from the context must update the affected artifact — the Rule, the Agent definition, or the Skill. The Decision Log records every change. The context is alive. Every mutation is deliberate and recorded.

## Quick reference

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Root cause | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Over-Context** | Rigid, mechanical output | Rules/Skills too prescriptive | Use Levels 1-2 for low-impact decisions |
| **Silent Agent** | Phantom features, context drift | Missing or weak gap protocol | Level 5 gap protocol Rule in every Agent |
| **Aspirational Context** | Elegant but inviable outputs | Constraints from Solution Brief ignored | Copy constraints literally into Rules |
| **Broken Chain** | Error amplification | QA skipped at chain links | QA validates every output before it moves |
| **Frozen Context** | Growing disconnect from reality | No update process | Decision Log + mandatory context updates |
