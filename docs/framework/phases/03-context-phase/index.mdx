# 3. Context phase

This is the operational guide for executing Context Phase — the phase where the team translates human understanding into a system that AI can process faithfully. While the [methodology section](/phases/context-phase) explains the *why* and the conceptual foundations (what Agents, Rules, and Skills are and why they matter), this guide covers the *how*: the concrete process to follow, the artifacts to produce, the criteria to meet before moving forward, and the failure patterns to watch for.

## The Context Phase workflow

Context Phase translates human understanding into a system that AI can process faithfully, through five steps in strict sequence. Rules come first because everything else depends on them. Agents are designed before Skills because Skills need to know who will execute them. Strategic documents come before decomposition because Skills are derived from them. Validation is last because it tests the complete system, not individual pieces.

## The six artifacts

This phase produces six artifacts that together form the operating system for Phase 4. Unlike previous phases, here artifacts are produced by both humans and AI Agents, and each has defined producers and consumers within the chain.

1. **project-context.md (Rules)** — The project constitution. Global norms that every Agent loads before executing any Skill: stack, conventions, constraints, Agent limits, gap protocol, justified decisions.
   **Format:** Markdown file, 2-5 pages. Lives in the project root.
   **Built by:** Context Engineer (initial version). Architect Agent (updates).

2. **Agent Definitions** — Identity cards for each AI role: who they are, what they do, what they can't do, which Rules govern them, what to do when information is missing.
   **Format:** One Markdown document per Agent or single document with separated sections.
   **Built by:** Context Engineer.

3. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** — What to build, for whom, use cases, success criteria, priorities. Translation of the Solution Brief into product language.
   **Format:** Structured document (Markdown, Google Docs).
   **Built by:** PM Agent from the Solution Brief.

4. **Architecture Document** — Technical decisions (ADRs), data model, AI strategy, non-functional requirements. Its decisions become new Rules.
   **Format:** Document with ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).
   **Built by:** Architect Agent. Decisions promoted to project-context.md.

5. **Story Files (Skills)** — Self-contained tasks with objective, specific context, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and constraints. Each Skill is one interaction between an Agent and its work.
   **Format:** One Markdown file per Skill, five mandatory elements.
   **Built by:** SM Agent.

6. **Decision Log** — Every change to Rules, Agents, or Skills from their creation: date, what changed, why, who authorized it, which artifacts were affected.
   **Format:** Chronological log (Markdown, spreadsheet).
   **Built by:** All participants. Continuous from the first document.

## Context system quality

A well-designed context system scores high across all five quality dimensions. Gaps in any dimension produce outputs that look correct but aren't faithful to what stakeholders agreed.

<RadarChart
  axes={['Fidelity', 'Completeness', 'Self-containment', 'Traceability', 'Consistency']}
  datasets={[
    {label: 'Well-designed system', values: [95, 90, 85, 95, 90], color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
    {label: 'System with gaps', values: [60, 45, 40, 35, 50], color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
  ]}
/>

- **Fidelity** — Outputs match the Problem Statement and Solution Brief. No invention, no reinterpretation.
- **Completeness** — Every Rule, Agent, and Skill has all mandatory elements. No implicit context.
- **Self-containment** — An Agent with a Skill + project-context.md can complete the task without asking anything.
- **Traceability** — Problem Statement → Solution Brief → PRD → Rules + Skills. Every element traces back.
- **Consistency** — Rules don't contradict each other. Skills inherit Rules faithfully. Agents respect their limits.

## What this guide covers

:::tip The operating system investment
If Context Phase consumes more time than the construction phase itself, you're likely over-specifying Rules or atomizing Skills excessively. If it consumes less than a third of construction time, there are implicit Rules and incomplete Skills. The optimal proportion is **30-50% of construction time.** For a project that will take 4 weeks to build, invest 1-2 weeks in Context Phase. The payoff: construction becomes the phase of least friction.
