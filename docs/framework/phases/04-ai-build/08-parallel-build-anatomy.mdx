# Parallel construction anatomy

Parallel construction is not simply "several people working at once." It's a system with internal structure: a graph that determines what can happen simultaneously, a coordination mechanism that makes visible what's happening in each track, synchronization points that verify coherence, and a validation agent that protects the integrity of the whole.

## Layer 1: The dependency graph

The dependency graph is the document that determines what can be built in parallel and what must wait. It's produced by the SM Agent in Phase 3 and verified by all Dev Leads during Phase 4 setup.

### Graph elements

```
Story File A ──────────────────────────────── [independent]
Story File B ──────────────────────────────── [independent]
Story File C ──→ depends on A ─────────────── [sequential after A]
Story File D ──→ depends on B ─────────────── [sequential after B]
Story File E ──→ integration of C + D ─────── [waits for C and D]
```

Each graph node has:
- **Story File(s)** that compose it
- **Track** it's assigned to
- **Explicit dependencies** (what must be completed before)
- **Synchronization point** (if it's an integration node)

### Relationship types

| Relationship | Parallelizable? | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| **Independent** | Yes | project-context.md Rules are sufficient for both to complete without communication. |
| **Direct dependency** | No | The output of one is the input of the other. Mandatory sequence. |
| **Shared data dependency** | Conditionally | Yes, if the data schema is defined as a global Rule in project-context.md. |
| **Integration dependency** | Parallel until integration | Each is built in its track. The integration Skill waits until both are validated. |

## Layer 2: The distributed Decision Log

In parallel construction, the Decision Log is the team's nervous system. Each entry contains additional fields compared to sequential construction:

| Field | Description | Parallel-specific |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision made** | What was decided that wasn't in the Story File. | — |
| **Affected Story File** | Reference to the Skill. | — |
| **Construction track** | Track identifier. | Mandatory. Without it, the Context Engineer cannot triage. |
| **Estimated impact** | Local / Cross-track / Global | The most critical field. Activates different protocols depending on the value. |
| **Resolution urgency** | Immediate / Deferred / Informative | Determines whether the Context Engineer needs to intervene now. |
| **Status** | Open / Under review / Resolved (local) / Resolved (global Rule) / Pending Phase 5 | The Context Engineer reviews all "Cross-track" entries before each synchronization. |

### Three properties of the distributed Decision Log

1. **Real-time visibility** — All entries from all tracks are accessible to the Context Engineer and Tech Lead the moment they're registered.
2. **Track impact classification** — The developer (closest to the decision) classifies whether it's local, cross-track, or global.
3. **Cross-track alert protocol** — An entry classified as "cross-track" triggers review between Dev Leads of both tracks and the Tech Lead.

:::tip Health indicator
The most useful health indicator for the Decision Log is not the total number of entries, but the **speed between a gap's occurrence and its registration.** A gap registered in the moment has zero communication cost. A gap registered two days later has the cost of everything built on top of it.

## Layer 3: Integration synchronizations

Synchronizations are not scheduled by calendar. They're scheduled by the dependency graph.

| Type | When triggered | Who participates | What is verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Schema** | Before starting tracks with shared data dependency. | Context Engineer + Dev Leads of affected tracks. | The schema in project-context.md is precise enough for both tracks. |
| **Interface** | When two Skills from different tracks define the communication interface. | Dev Leads + Tech Lead. | The contract (API, message schema, protocol) is compatible. |
| **Major integration** | When all Skills in a dependency group are QA-validated. | Tech Lead + Dev Leads from all tracks in the group. | Outputs integrate without collision. The integration Skill can execute. |
| **Partial fidelity review** | Every 3-4 Stories completed across the set. | Context Engineer + representative from each track. | The global state remains recognizable as an expression of the Problem Statement. |

Each synchronization produces **minutes** that document: agreed contracts, decisions on incompatibilities, and affected tracks.

## Layer 4: The QA Agent in parallel construction

In sequential construction, the QA Agent validates Story Files independently. In parallel, it has an additional role: it's the first mechanism for detecting incoherences between tracks.

| Validation type | In sequential | Additional in parallel |
|---|---|---|
| **Acceptance criteria** | Verifies all Story File criteria. | No changes. |
| **Rules conformity** | Verifies the output respects project-context.md. | Verifies the **most recent version**. If it was updated during execution, forces re-execution. |
| **PRD traceability** | Flags functionalities without PRD reference. | Indicates which track originated the untraced functionality. |
| **Contract compatibility** | Not applicable. | Verifies the output is compatible with the interface contract defined in the schema synchronization. |
| **Absence of context drift** | Detects inconsistent patterns within a track. | Detects inconsistent patterns **between tracks** (e.g., different naming conventions across tracks). |
