# Phase 03: Context Engineering

This is the operational guide for executing Context Engineering — the phase where the team translates human understanding into a system that AI can process faithfully. While the [methodology section](/phases/context-engineering) explains the *why* and the conceptual foundations (what Agents, Rules, and Skills are and why they matter), this guide covers the *how*: the concrete process to follow, the artifacts to produce, the criteria to meet before moving forward, and the failure patterns to watch for.

## The process at a glance

Context Engineering is a structured process with five steps. Each step builds on the previous one — the sequence matters because later artifacts depend on earlier decisions.

| Step | What happens | Duration | Key output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Establish Rules** | Define the project constitution: tech stack, conventions, constraints, agent limits, gap protocol. All decisions that apply globally. | 1-2 days | project-context.md (v1) |
| **2. Design the Agent Chain** | Define which Agents exist, what each one does, and how they pass work to each other. Each with identity, responsibilities, limits, rules, and gap protocol. | 1-2 days | Agent Definitions |
| **3. Generate Strategic Documents** | The PM Agent produces the PRD from the Solution Brief; the Architect Agent produces the Architecture Document and promotes new Rules. | 2-5 days | PRD + Architecture Document + updated Rules |
| **4. Decompose into Skills** | The SM Agent breaks the solution into self-contained tasks with all the context an Agent needs to complete them. | 2-5 days | Story Files (Skills) |
| **5. Validate through Outputs** | Agents execute sample Skills under Rules. Stakeholders verify: "Is this recognizable as a faithful expression of what we agreed?" | 1-3 days | Validated context system |

The sequence is strict. Rules come first because everything else depends on them. Agents come before Skills because Skills need to know which Agent will execute them. Strategic documents come before Skills because Skills are decomposed from them. Validation is last because it tests the complete system, not individual pieces.

## The six artifacts

This phase produces six artifacts that together form the operating system for Phase 4 (AI Build):

1. **project-context.md (Rules)** — The constitution. Global norms that every Agent loads before executing any Skill: tech stack, conventions, constraints, agent limits, gap protocol, justified decisions.
2. **Agent Definitions** — Identity cards for each AI role: who they are, what they do, what they can't do, which Rules govern them, what to do when information is missing.
3. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** — What to build, for whom, use cases, success criteria, priorities. Produced by the PM Agent from the Solution Brief.
4. **Architecture Document** — Technical decisions (ADRs), data model, AI strategy, non-functional requirements. Produced by the Architect Agent — and critically, its decisions become new Rules.
5. **Story Files (Skills)** — Self-contained tasks with objective, specific context, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and constraints. Each Skill is one interaction between an Agent and its work.
6. **Decision Log** — Every change to Rules, Agents, or Skills from their creation. Continuous traceability.

None of these artifacts works alone. The project-context.md without Agent Definitions is a policy manual with no one to enforce it. Agent Definitions without Skills are roles without work. Skills without Rules are tasks without standards.

## What this guide covers

:::tip The operating system investment
If Context Engineering consumes more time than the construction phase itself, you're likely over-specifying Rules or atomizing Skills excessively. If it consumes less than a third of construction time, there are implicit Rules and incomplete Skills. The optimal proportion is **30-50% of construction time.** For a project that will take 4 weeks to build, invest 1-2 weeks in Context Engineering. The payoff: construction becomes the phase of least friction.
