# No-exit criterion: why this phase doesn't end

All previous phases have a Gate Review: a set of conditions that, when met, authorize advancement to the next phase. Phase 5 has no Gate Review because **there is no next phase**.

Instead, it has a **continuous health criterion**: the signal system is active, signals are interpreted regularly, the Context Document is updated in response to them, and the team can articulate what it learned in the last cycle that it didn't know in the previous one.

## Healthy operation indicators

| # | Indicator | Verification frequency |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Signal Log has entries from the last two weeks with documented cause hypotheses. | Weekly |
| 2 | The Context Update Record has at least one entry per active iteration cycle. | Monthly |
| 3 | The previous cycle's Iteration Brief is documented and accessible. | At each cycle start |
| 4 | KPIs from the KPI & OKR Register are connected to active data sources and update automatically. | Weekly |
| 5 | At least one non-technical stakeholder (from Phases 1-2) reviews the Signal Log regularly. | Monthly |
| 6 | The Problem Statement has been explicitly reviewed in the last 90 days. | Quarterly |
| 7 | The team can answer: *"What did we learn in the last cycle that we didn't know at the start?"* | At each cycle close |

## Unhealthy operation signs

:::danger[Red alerts]
Any of these signs indicates Phase 5 has stopped functioning as a learning system:

- **Empty Signal Log:** No new entries in over **two weeks** during active operation.
- **Frozen Context Document:** Not updated in over **60 days** during active operation.
- **Recurring problems:** The same user problems appear in **three consecutive cycles** of feedback without producing a Context Document update.
- **Disconnected stakeholders:** No stakeholders from Phases 1-2 have reviewed the Signal Log in the **last quarter**.

## The closure criterion (rare)

There is a closure criterion Phase 5 can reach, though it rarely occurs before the product itself reaches end of life:

> The moment when **all Problem Statement assumptions have been confirmed** or **the problem has ceased to exist**.

At that moment, Phase 5 doesn't end — the product ends.

## Health checklist — for use at each strategic review

```
□ Active Signal Log with recent entries (<2 weeks)
□ Documented cause hypotheses for significant signals
□ Up-to-date Context Update Record (≥1 entry per cycle)
□ Previous cycle's Iteration Brief available
□ KPI Dashboard connected and updated
□ At least 1 non-technical stakeholder reviews signals regularly
□ Problem Statement reviewed in last 90 days
□ Team articulates concrete learnings from last cycle
□ Interpretation sessions produce updates, not just discussions
□ Same problems do NOT repeat in consecutive cycles without action
```

:::tip[The Gate Review question that doesn't exist]
In previous phases, the Gate Review question is: *"Are we ready to advance?"*

In Phase 5, the question is: **"Are we learning?"**

If the answer is yes, the system is healthy. If the answer is no, there is Context Debt accumulating that must be processed before any new construction cycle.
