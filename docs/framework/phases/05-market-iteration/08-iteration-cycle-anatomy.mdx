# Iteration cycle anatomy

The Market Iteration cycle is not a linear process executed once. It's a system of **nested loops** operating at different cadences. Understanding this anatomy is what allows the team to operate Phase 5 without it consuming all available time.

## The three cycle loops

### Inner loop: continuous observation

**Cadence:** Real time → weekly.

| Activity | Frequency | Automation |
|---|---|---|
| KPI dashboards updated | Real time | 100% automatic |
| Threshold crossing alerts | Real time | 100% automatic |
| Weekly KPI and behavior review | Weekly (45-60 min) | Human with automatic data |
| Signal Log entries from automatic layer | Continuous | 100% automatic |

**Output:** Raw signals captured and preliminarily classified. Alerts requiring immediate attention.

### Middle loop: synthesis and update

**Cadence:** Monthly.

| Activity | Frequency | Automation |
|---|---|---|
| Qualitative feedback synthesis session | Monthly (2-3h) | Human |
| Ticket and support channel analysis | Weekly-monthly | Partial (AI synthesis) |
| Rule and Story File updates | As needed | Human (AI proposals at level 3+) |
| Context Update Record | With each update | Human |

**Output:** Refined Signal Log with cause hypotheses. Updated Context Document. Up-to-date Context Update Record.

### Outer loop: strategic review

**Cadence:** Quarterly.

| Activity | Frequency | Automation |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic review with stakeholders | Quarterly (half day) | Human |
| Problem Statement validity review | Quarterly | Human |
| External and competitive signal analysis | Monthly-quarterly | Partial |
| Iteration Brief writing | At each cycle close | AI draft (level 3+) |

**Output:** Next cycle's Iteration Brief. Decision to return to earlier phases if applicable.

## The signal-cause-context chain

The chain is the central mechanism that transforms market data into Context Document updates. Each significant signal must traverse the complete chain before producing a change.

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Observed signal     │ ← Raw market data
│  (behavior,          │
│   KPI, feedback)     │
└────────┬────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Behavior behind     │ ← What is the user doing?
│  the signal          │
└────────┬────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Unmet need or       │ ← What problem doesn't
│  unresolved problem  │    the current solution solve?
└────────┬────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Affected Context    │ ← Which part of the Context
│  Document element    │    Document didn't capture
│                      │    this reality?
└─────────────────────┘
```

:::warning[Golden rule]
If the team can't complete the chain to the Context Document element that needs updating, **it doesn't have enough understanding of the signal to act on it**. It needs more data or deeper analysis.
:::

## The update flow

Not all Context Document updates have the same process or urgency.

| Urgency | Change type | Response time | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Immediate** | Technical Rule affecting production operation | Same day | Context Engineer |
| **Normal** | Story File adjustment, new Rule from emerging pattern | 1-3 days, next iteration | Context Engineer + Product Lead |
| **Strategic** | Solution Brief or Problem Statement revision | Weeks. Formal return to Phase 1 or 2. | Full stakeholders |

## Signs of a healthy cycle

- Each turn of the middle loop produces at least one Context Update Record entry
- The Iteration Brief can articulate concrete learnings linked to specific signals
- Phase 1-2 stakeholders participate in the outer loop
- Time spent on manual capture decreases progressively
- The same problems do NOT appear in consecutive cycles without producing changes

:::danger[Signs of an unhealthy cycle]
- The inner loop operates but the middle and outer loops don't execute
- The Signal Log grows but the Context Update Record doesn't
- Interpretation sessions produce discussions but not updates
- The Iteration Brief is a copy-paste of the previous one with changed dates
