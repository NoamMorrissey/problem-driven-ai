# Duration and effort

Phase 5 has no duration. It has a **permanent regime**. What varies between projects is not how long it lasts but how much effort its operation requires at different moments in the product's lifecycle.

## Intensity by lifecycle moment

| Lifecycle moment | Intensity | Main activities | Approximate dedication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First 4-8 weeks** post-launch | High. Maximum attention to adoption signals and assumption validation. | Daily KPI review. Weekly follow-up interviews. Very active Signal Log. First Iteration Brief. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **40-60%** of their time on Phase 5. |
| **2-6 months** post-launch | Medium-high. Critical assumptions already confirmed or refuted. Measurement system mature. | Weekly KPI review. Monthly interviews. Monthly qualitative synthesis. Monthly Iteration Briefs. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **20-30%** of their time. |
| **6-18 months** post-launch | Medium. System established. Cycles are longer and signals more predictable. | Automated KPIs. Monthly interviews. Quarterly strategic review. Quarterly Iteration Briefs. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **10-20%** of their time. |
| **18+ months** post-launch | Low-medium with strategic peaks. System is mature. Learning cycles are longer but more structural. | Continuous automatic monitoring. Monthly synthesis. Quarterly or semi-annual strategic review. | 10-15% of product team time. **30-40%** peaks during strategic reviews producing returns to Phases 1-2. |

## The general rule

:::tip[Intensity is inversely proportional to context maturity]
Phase 5 requires more human effort when the Context Document is less precise. In the first weeks post-launch, the context is a sophisticated hypothesis. The market tests it intensely and the team must be highly attentive.

As the Context Document incorporates market learnings and gains precision, automation can absorb more capture and synthesis work. Human effort doesn't disappear — it shifts from routine analysis toward the strategic decisions only humans can make.

## Effort distribution by activity

### First 8 weeks (high intensity)

| Activity | % of Phase 5 time |
|---|---|
| Monitoring and signal capture | 30% |
| Interpretation and analysis | 35% |
| Context Document updating | 20% |
| Documentation (Signal Log, CUR, Iteration Brief) | 15% |

### Steady state (6+ months)

| Activity | % of Phase 5 time |
|---|---|
| Monitoring and signal capture | 15% (mostly automatic) |
| Interpretation and analysis | 40% |
| Context Document updating | 15% |
| Strategic review and planning | 20% |
| Documentation | 10% |

## Signs of underinvestment

| Signal | What it indicates | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Signal Log not updated in 2+ weeks | Nobody is dedicating time to capture | Context Debt accumulating |
| Interpretation sessions are recurrently canceled | Phase 5 doesn't have organizational priority | Blind iteration |
| Iteration Brief is written in 30 minutes | No deep analysis behind it | Cycles without real learning |
| Only the Context Engineer works on Phase 5 | Lack of multidisciplinary perspective | Biased interpretations |

## Signs of overinvestment

| Signal | What it indicates | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Team spends 60%+ of time on analysis without producing updates | Analysis paralysis | Context Document doesn't improve despite effort |
| Every minor signal generates a full interpretation session | No significance filter | Team fatigue |
| Context Document is updated daily | Excessive reactivity | Incoherence between updates |
| Stakeholders meet weekly for Phase 5 | Coordination overload | Stakeholders disconnect from fatigue |

## Minimum team composition

| Role | Minimum dedication (steady state) | Critical for |
|---|---|---|
| **Product Lead** | 10-15% | Interpretation and prioritization |
| **Context Engineer** | 15-20% | Updates and traceability |
| **Data Lead** | 5-10% | Measurement system maintenance |
| **1 non-technical stakeholder** | 2-4h/month | Monthly + quarterly review |

:::warning[The most common mistake]
Planning Phase 5 with 0% dedication. Many teams assume that after go-live the product maintains itself and the team moves to the next project. Without explicit Phase 5 dedication, the Context Document freezes and the entire investment in Phases 1-4 progressively loses value.
