# Effort

Phase 5 has no duration. It has a **permanent regime**. What varies between projects is not how long it lasts but how much effort its operation requires at different moments in the product's lifecycle.

## Intensity by lifecycle stage

| Lifecycle stage | Intensity | Main activities | Approximate dedication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Immediate post-launch** | High. Maximum attention to adoption signals and assumption validation. | Frequent KPI review. Active follow-up interviews. Very active Signal Log. First Iteration Brief. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **40-60%** of their dedication on Phase 5. |
| **Early stabilization** | Medium-high. Critical assumptions already confirmed or refuted. Measurement system mature. | Regular KPI review. Periodic interviews. Recurring qualitative synthesis. Regular Iteration Briefs. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **20-30%** of their dedication. |
| **Established operation** | Medium. System established. Cycles are more spaced and signals more predictable. | Automated KPIs. Periodic interviews. Regular strategic review. Periodic Iteration Briefs. | Product Lead + Context Engineer: **10-20%** of their dedication. |
| **Maturity** | Low-medium with strategic peaks. System is mature. Learning cycles are longer but more structural. | Continuous automatic monitoring. Periodic synthesis. Regular strategic review. | 10-15% of product team dedication. **30-40%** peaks during strategic reviews producing returns to Phases 1-2. |

## The general rule

:::tip[Intensity is inversely proportional to context maturity]
Phase 5 requires more human effort when the Context Document is less precise. In the stage immediately following launch, the context is a sophisticated hypothesis. The market tests it intensely and the team must be highly attentive.

As the Context Document incorporates market learnings and gains precision, automation can absorb more capture and synthesis work. Human effort doesn't disappear — it shifts from routine analysis toward the strategic decisions only humans can make.

## Effort distribution by activity

### High intensity (post-launch)

| Activity | Proportion of effort |
|---|---|
| Monitoring and signal capture | 30% |
| Interpretation and analysis | 35% |
| Context Document updating | 20% |
| Documentation (Signal Log, CUR, Iteration Brief) | 15% |

### Steady state (established operation)

| Activity | Proportion of effort |
|---|---|
| Monitoring and signal capture | 15% (mostly automatic) |
| Interpretation and analysis | 40% |
| Context Document updating | 15% |
| Strategic review and planning | 20% |
| Documentation | 10% |

## Signs of insufficient effort

| Signal | What it indicates | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Signal Log not updated regularly | Nobody is dedicating effort to capture | Context Debt accumulating |
| Interpretation sessions are recurrently canceled | Phase 5 doesn't have organizational priority | Blind iteration |
| Iteration Brief is produced without deep analysis | No reflection behind it | Cycles without real learning |
| Only the Context Engineer works on Phase 5 | Lack of multidisciplinary perspective | Biased interpretations |

## Signs of excessive effort

| Signal | What it indicates | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Team dedicates most of its effort to analysis without producing updates | Analysis paralysis | Context Document doesn't improve despite effort |
| Every minor signal generates a full interpretation session | No significance filter | Team fatigue |
| Context Document is updated with excessive frequency | Excessive reactivity | Incoherence between updates |
| Stakeholders participate in reviews with excessive frequency | Coordination overload | Stakeholders disconnect from fatigue |

## Minimum team composition

| Role | Minimum dedication (steady state) | Critical for |
|---|---|---|
| **Product Lead** | 10-15% | Interpretation and prioritization |
| **Context Engineer** | 15-20% | Updates and traceability |
| **Data Lead** | 5-10% | Measurement system maintenance |
| **1 non-technical stakeholder** | Periodic review | Business perspective in reviews |

:::warning[The most common mistake]
Planning Phase 5 with 0% dedication. Many teams assume that after go-live the product maintains itself and the team moves to the next project. Without explicit Phase 5 dedication, the Context Document freezes and the entire investment in Phases 1-4 progressively loses value.
