# 4. AI build phase

## Building well because it was thought well

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 4. While the [methodology section](/phases/ai-build-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.

### The process in five steps

| Step | Name | Main output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Environment setup** | Aligned team, verified graph, operational Decision Log |
| 2 | **Story File construction** | Story Files completed and validated by QA |
| 3 | **Gap management** | Gaps classified and resolved, Rules updated |
| 4 | **Fidelity review** | Signed Build Validation Report |
| 5 | **Decision Log closure** | Consolidated Decision Log, Iteration Brief |

### Phase artifacts

- **Distributed Decision Log** — One log per track with cross-impact classification
- **Updated dependency graph** — Reference document for activating/deactivating tracks
- **Integration synchronization minutes** — Interface contracts and resolutions
- **Build Validation Report** — Signed by Tech Lead and Phase 1-2 stakeholders
- **Updated Context Document** — Rules emerged during construction incorporated
- **Iteration Brief (draft)** — Open learnings for Phase 5
