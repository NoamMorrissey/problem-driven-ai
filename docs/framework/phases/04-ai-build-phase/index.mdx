# 4. AI build phase

## Building well because it was thought well

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 4. While the [methodology section](/phases/ai-build-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.

## The AI Build Phase workflow

AI Build Phase executes construction in five steps that manage parallel tracks, detect collisions between them, and validate the result with the original stakeholders. The environment is verified before building anything. Agents execute Story Files under human supervision. Gaps are classified and resolved in real time. The fidelity review confirms that what was built solves the original problem and respects the agreed solution. Closure consolidates learnings for the market cycle.

### Phase artifacts

This phase produces six artifacts that record decisions made during construction, discovered dependencies, and validation that what was built is faithful to the original problem and solution.

<ArtifactAccordion>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Distributed Decision Log">
    Chronological log of decisions per track with impact classification: local, cross-track, or global. One log per track, accessible to the entire team.

    **Format:** Chronological log per track (Google Sheets, spreadsheet). Consolidated at closure.

    **Built by:** Dev Leads per track. Context Engineer consolidates at closure.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Updated dependency graph">
    Directed graph with nodes (Story Files) and edges (dependencies). Inherited from Phase 3, updated when construction reveals undocumented dependencies.

    **Format:** Directed graph (Miro, draw.io, diagramming tool).

    **Built by:** SM Agent (Phase 3 origin). Updates authorized by Context Engineer.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Integration synchronization minutes">
    Interface contracts and resolutions when there are incompatibilities between tracks.

    **Format:** Meeting minutes (Google Docs).

    **Built by:** Tech Lead convenes. Context Engineer documents.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Build Validation Report">
    Fidelity review result across 4 blocks: integration coherence, Problem Statement fidelity, Solution Brief fidelity, and Decision Log review.

    **Format:** Structured document in 4 blocks, signed.

    **Built by:** Team. Signatories: Tech Lead, Phase 1-2 stakeholders, Context Engineer.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Updated Context Document">
    project-context.md with all Rules emerged from construction, plus updated dependency graph and integration decisions.

    **Format:** Markdown files (same structure as Phase 3).

    **Built by:** Context Engineer.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Iteration Brief (draft)">
    Hypotheses to validate, decisions pending market data, and assumptions that construction could neither confirm nor refute.

    **Format:** Structured document (Google Docs).

    **Built by:** Context Engineer / Product Lead with learnings from all tracks.
