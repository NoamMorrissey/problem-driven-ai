# 4. AI build phase

## Building well because it was thought well

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 4. While the [methodology section](/phases/ai-build-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.
