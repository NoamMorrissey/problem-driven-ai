# 1. Problem discovery

This is the operational guide for executing Problem Discovery — the phase where the team investigates the real problem before thinking about solutions. While the [methodology section](/phases/problem-discovery) explains the *why* and the conceptual foundations, this guide covers the *how*: the concrete process to follow, the artifacts to produce, the criteria to meet before moving forward, and the failure patterns to watch for.

## The Discovery workflow

This linear view represents the core path from identifying a problem to passing the final Gate Review. It requires coordination between the Facilitator, Researcher, and Decision Owner.

## The process at a glance

Problem Discovery is a structured process with four steps. Each step has a specific purpose and produces a partial deliverable that feeds the next. The discipline in the sequence is what differentiates a rigorous discovery from a well-intentioned conversation.

| Step | What happens | Duration | Key output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Discovery Kick-off** | Align scope, build the Actor Map, document starting hypotheses and their inversions, design the Interview Guide, assign roles. | 1 session (2-3h) | Actor Map + Interview Guide |
| **2. In-depth Interviews** | Structured conversations with the people who live the problem. Minimum 5 interviews with diversity of roles and perspectives. | 45-60 min × 5+ interviews | Raw findings (literal notes, no interpretation yet) |
| **3. Findings Synthesis** | The full team groups anonymized findings by patterns, identifies tensions and outliers, and distills the real problem that emerges from the data. | 1-2 sessions (3-4h each) | Synthesis Board |
| **4. Problem Statement** | Draft, iterate, and validate the problem definition at two levels: with users who live the problem and with the decision owner. | 1-2 days drafting + 2-3 days validation | Problem Statement (validated) |

The sequence matters. A kick-off without an Actor Map produces interviews with blind spots. Interviews without a guide produce inconsistent data. Synthesis before completing all interviews produces anchored conclusions. A Problem Statement without external validation produces false confidence.

## The four artifacts

This phase produces four artifacts that together form the foundation for Phase 2 (Solution Alignment):

1. **Actor Map** — Visual map of everyone who touches the problem: who lives it, who decides whether it gets solved, who is affected by the solution, who has tried to solve it before, and who has information the team isn't seeing.
2. **Interview Guide** — Open question guide structured in four blocks (opening, exploration, depth, closing), including at least one question designed to challenge the team's main hypothesis.
3. **Synthesis Board** — Visual map of anonymized findings grouped by patterns, with affinity groupings, identified tensions, outliers, and hypotheses explicitly confirmed or refuted.
4. **Problem Statement** — Problem definition of no more than half a page with seven elements: the gap, the owner, the success criteria, the constraints, the actors, the temporal context, and the cost of inaction.

None of these artifacts is optional. They are the evidence that the work was done rigorously and the memory that feeds everything that follows. When the team passes the Gate Review, these four documents travel together to Phase 2 — they contain the defined problem, the people surrounding it, the evidence that supports it, and the method by which it was discovered.

## The cost of error

Why invest in Discovery? Because fixing a misunderstood problem in Production costs **100x more** than fixing it during Discovery. The earlier the error is caught, the cheaper the correction.

  {label: 'Discovery', value: '1x', height: 40, color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
  {label: 'Development', value: '10x', height: 130, color: 'var(--ifm-color-warning)'},
  {label: 'Production', value: '100x', height: 250, color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},

This is not theory. It is the most consistent finding in software engineering research: **the cost of change grows exponentially with each phase**. Discovery is the cheapest moment to be wrong.

:::tip The investment that pays for itself
Every hour invested in properly understanding the problem saves weeks of misguided building, rework cycles, realignment meetings, and — above all — the erosion of trust that occurs when a team delivers something nobody needed. If you're dedicating less than 15% of the project's total time to Problem Discovery, you're probably investing too little. The sweet spot is between 15% and 25%.
