# Duration and effort

Problem Discovery has no fixed duration because it depends on the complexity of the problem, user accessibility, and the team's prior knowledge level. However, these are typical references:

| Scenario | Duration | What it includes |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple problem, accessible users** | 1-2 weeks | 5 interviews + 1 synthesis session + 1 validation round. |
| **Medium complexity problem** | 2-3 weeks | 5-8 interviews + contextual observation + 2 synthesis sessions + iterated validation. |
| **Complex problem, multiple stakeholders** | 3-5 weeks | 8-12 interviews with different profiles + quantitative analysis + extended synthesis + validation with multiple groups + constraint verification. |

**General rule:** if you're dedicating less than 15% of the project's total time to Problem Discovery, you're probably investing too little. If you're dedicating more than 30%, you're probably over-analyzing. The sweet spot is between 15% and 25% of total time.
