# Effort

Problem Discovery is not measured in weeks. It's measured in activities completed with enough rigor to produce a Problem Statement that withstands validation. The problem's complexity determines the depth of effort, not the calendar duration.

## Effort by complexity

| Scenario | Minimum activities | Required depth |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple problem, accessible users** | 5 interviews + 1 synthesis session + 1 validation round. | Interviews are straightforward. Synthesis produces clear patterns. Validation confirms in one cycle. |
| **Medium complexity problem** | 5-8 interviews + contextual observation + 2 synthesis sessions + iterated validation. | Interviews cover diverse perspectives. Synthesis requires multiple passes. Validation needs at least two cycles. |
| **Complex problem, multiple stakeholders** | 8-12 interviews with different profiles + quantitative analysis + extended synthesis + validation with multiple groups + constraint verification. | Interviews span all affected profiles. Synthesis integrates qualitative and quantitative sources. Validation includes verification with each stakeholder group. |

## Effort allocation

A healthy Discovery process is not just "talking to people." It requires significant effort in Synthesis and Validation to avoid confirmation bias.

The most common mistake is spending 80% of the effort on interviews and 20% on everything else. The ratio should be closer to 30/70: **30% gathering data, 70% making sense of it and validating it**.

## The minimum effort rule

:::tip[Effort is measured in activities, not calendar]
The minimum effort threshold for a rigorous Problem Discovery includes three non-negotiable components:

1. **At least 5 quality interviews** with people who live the problem.
2. **A rigorous synthesis** that produces documented patterns, tensions, and outliers.
3. **Two levels of validation** (with those who live the problem and with those who decide whether to solve it).

A team that has completed these three components has the foundation for a solid Problem Statement. A team that hasn't — regardless of the calendar — has a hypothesis disguised as a definition.

## Signs of insufficient effort

- Fewer than 5 interviews conducted.
- The Synthesis Board has few notes and "obvious" patterns. There are no outliers or tensions.
- The Problem Statement is identical to the starting hypothesis documented at the kick-off. No interview changed anything the team believed at the start.
- The team can't articulate what surprised them during discovery.
- Constraints haven't been verified with their sources.

## Signs of excessive effort

- The team keeps adding interviews but the new findings repeat patterns already identified.
- Synthesis sessions produce refinements, not new insights.
- The Problem Statement has been rewritten more than three times without substantive changes.
- The team is using discovery as a way to delay the discomfort of committing to a problem definition.

:::tip[The principle of sufficient effort]
The right effort is not the maximum possible — it's the minimum necessary for the Problem Statement to be a faithful expression of reality, not a projection of the team's assumptions. **When interviews stop producing surprises and validation confirms without exceptions, the effort has been sufficient.**
