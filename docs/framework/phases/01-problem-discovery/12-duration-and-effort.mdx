# Duration and effort

Problem Discovery has no fixed duration because it depends on the complexity of the problem, user accessibility, and the team's prior knowledge level. However, these are typical references:

| Scenario | Duration | What it includes |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple problem, accessible users** | 1-2 weeks | 5 interviews + 1 synthesis session + 1 validation round. |
| **Medium complexity problem** | 2-3 weeks | 5-8 interviews + contextual observation + 2 synthesis sessions + iterated validation. |
| **Complex problem, multiple stakeholders** | 3-5 weeks | 8-12 interviews with different profiles + quantitative analysis + extended synthesis + validation with multiple groups + constraint verification. |

**General rule:** if you're dedicating less than 15% of the project's total time to Problem Discovery, you're probably investing too little. If you're dedicating more than 30%, you're probably over-analyzing. The sweet spot is between 15% and 25% of total time.

## Warning signs: too little or too much

### Signs you're under-investing

- Fewer than 5 interviews conducted.
- The Synthesis Board has few notes and "obvious" patterns. There are no outliers or tensions.
- The Problem Statement is identical to the starting hypothesis documented at the kick-off. No interview changed anything the team believed at the start.
- The team can't articulate what surprised them during discovery.
- Constraints haven't been verified with their sources.

### Signs you're over-analyzing

- The team keeps adding interviews but the new findings repeat patterns already identified.
- Synthesis sessions produce refinements, not new insights.
- The Problem Statement has been rewritten more than three times without substantive changes.
- The team is using discovery as a way to delay the discomfort of committing to a problem definition.

### What the 15-25% rule means in practice

For a 12-week project, Problem Discovery should take between 2 and 3 weeks. For a 6-month initiative, between 4 and 6 weeks. These are not arbitrary numbers — they reflect the minimum time needed to run at least 5 quality interviews, conduct a thorough synthesis, and complete two levels of validation. Compressing this below the threshold almost always produces a Problem Statement that looks right but hasn't been stress-tested against reality.
