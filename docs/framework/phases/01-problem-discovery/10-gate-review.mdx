# Exit Criteria: the Gate Review

Problem Discovery is not complete when the team feels it understands the problem. It's complete when simultaneous and verifiable conditions are met:

:::caution Gate 1 → 2: Passage conditions
- ✅ The Problem Statement has been validated directly with at least two of the clients or users interviewed and they recognize it as a faithful description of their reality.
- ✅ The success criteria has been validated with the decision owner and they recognize it as the definition of "solved."
- ✅ Documented constraints have been verified with the actors who impose them (IT for technical constraints, legal for regulatory, finance for budgetary).
- ✅ There is explicit agreement within the team on the Problem Statement's formulation. Not majority. Not silence interpreted as agreement. Real agreement.
- ✅ The Actor Map, Interview Guide, Synthesis Board, and Problem Statement are documented and accessible.
- ✅ Starting hypotheses have been explicitly confirmed or refuted.
- ❌ Do not advance if the Problem Statement hasn't been externally validated, even if the team is convinced it's correct.
- ❌ Do not advance if there are relevant disagreements within the team that haven't been resolved.
- ❌ Do not advance if the success criteria isn't defined or if different stakeholders have incompatible criteria that haven't been resolved.
:::

These exit criteria exist to protect the team from itself. The pressure to move forward is real. Deadlines are real. The temptation to accept a Problem Statement without externally validating it is enormous. But every shortcut here is paid for many times over in subsequent phases.
