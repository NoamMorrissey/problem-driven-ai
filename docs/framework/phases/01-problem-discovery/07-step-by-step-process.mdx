# The step-by-step process

Problem Discovery is not a free-form activity. It's a structured process with four clear steps, each with a specific purpose and a partial deliverable that feeds the next. Discipline in the sequence is what differentiates a rigorous discovery from a well-intentioned conversation.

## Step 1. Discovery Kick-off

*Estimated duration: 1 session of 2-3 hours*

The kick-off is not the discovery. It's the preparation for discovery. Its purpose is fourfold: align the team on the scope of the investigation, identify the people to be interviewed, make explicit the starting hypotheses the team brings with them, and build the Actor Map.

This last point is crucial. Every team arrives at discovery with prior hypotheses about the problem. Pretending they don't exist is counterproductive. The right thing to do is make them explicit, write them down, and hang them on the wall. Not to validate them, but so the team is aware of its biases and can actively challenge them during interviews.

### Kick-off activities

1. **Define the scope of the investigation:** what area of the problem we will explore and, with equal precision, what is out of scope.
2. **Build the Actor Map:** who lives the problem, who decides, who is affected, who has tried to solve it, who has information we're not seeing.
3. **Identify interviewees:** minimum 5, selected from the Actor Map with diversity of roles and perspectives.
4. **Document starting hypotheses:** what the team believes it knows about the problem. Also write the inverted hypothesis for each one.
5. **Identify known constraints:** budget, time, regulations, technical limitations, organizational politics. Not to solve anything, but to know what conditions the future solution space.
6. **Design the Interview Guide:** the question guide that will structure the interviews, including at least one question designed to challenge the main hypothesis.
7. **Assign roles:** who interviews, who takes notes, who coordinates logistics.

:::note Practical example: Kick-off for an inventory management project
**Starting hypothesis:** "Store managers need a dashboard to see inventory in real time."

**Inverted hypothesis:** "Managers already have the information they need but don't trust it" or "The problem isn't the information but the replenishment process."

**Actor Map:**
- *Live the problem:* Store managers (3 regions), warehouse managers.
- *Decide:* Retail operations director.
- *Indirectly affected:* Purchasing team (receiving orders based on outdated data), end customers.
- *Tried to solve it:* The IT team implemented an alert system a year ago. It didn't work. Why?
- *Know something we don't see:* The customer service team, which receives daily complaints about stock.

**Known constraints:** Legacy ERP with daily batch updates, limited integration budget, minimum stock regulations for health and food products.

**Scope:** Explore the inventory visibility problem. Out of scope: transportation logistics.

## Step 2. In-depth interviews

*Estimated duration: 45-60 minutes per interview × minimum 5 interviews*

Interviews are the heart of discovery. They are structured but not rigid conversations, designed to extract the real experience of the people who live the problem. They are not surveys. They are not questionnaires. They are conversations with a clear direction and enough flexibility to follow unexpected threads when they appear.

### The Interview Guide

The interview guide is not a script. It's a structure that ensures all interviews cover the six fundamental questions while leaving room for exploration. It's organized in four blocks:

| Block | Purpose | Sample questions |
|---|---|---|
| **Opening** (5-10 min) | Establish trust and context. It's not small talk: it's understanding the person's role, their relationship with the problem, and their willingness to share. | *"Tell me about your day-to-day. What's your main responsibility? How does it relate to [the problem area]?"* |
| **Problem exploration** (20-30 min) | The central block. This is where the six fundamental questions are answered. Follow the person's thread, not the guide's order. | *"Tell me about the last time you faced this. What happened? And why is that a problem? What have you tried to solve it?"* |
| **Depth** (10-15 min) | Follow the most interesting threads. Ask for specific examples. Quantify impacts. Search for the emotions behind the answers. | *"Can you give me a specific example? How many times does it happen per month? What do you feel when it occurs? What would you do if this were solved tomorrow?"* |
| **Close** (5 min) | Give space for the unasked. Frequently, the most valuable insight emerges here, when the person relaxes and adds something they didn't know how to say before. | *"Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think I should know? Anything else you'd like to add about this topic?"* |

### Golden rules of interviewing

1. **Never ask closed or leading questions.** "Do you think inventory is a problem?" is not a question. It's a suggestion in disguise. Ask open-ended: "What's the hardest part of your day-to-day?"
2. **Never propose solutions during the interview.** Your job is to understand, not to solve. If you propose a solution, the person will stop thinking about the problem and start evaluating your idea.
3. **Follow unexpected threads.** If the person mentions something not in your guide but seems relevant, follow that thread. The best findings are usually off-script.
4. **Seek stories, not opinions.** "Tell me about the last time..." produces much richer information than "What do you think about...?"
5. **Respect silences.** When the person goes quiet, don't fill the space. They're thinking. What comes after the silence is usually the most honest.
6. **Always go in pairs: one interviews, one takes notes.** Never interview alone. The note-taker captures what the interviewer can't see while conversing.

:::danger Anti-pattern: Trap Questions
*"Don't you think it would be useful to have a dashboard showing you inventory in real time?"*

This question contains the solution, suggests the answer, and makes it difficult for the person to say no. It's the equivalent of asking "wouldn't you like your life to be better?" The answer is always yes, and the information you get is zero.

**The correct version:** "Tell me how you know today how much stock you have of each product. What do you do when you need that information?"

### Why 5 interviews?

Qualitative research adheres to the law of diminishing returns. By the 5th interview, approximately 85% of core problems and patterns are typically identified. Additional interviews add diminishing value.

<SaturationChart
  data={[
    {label: '1', value: 35},
    {label: '2', value: 55},
    {label: '3', value: 70},
    {label: '5', value: 85},
    {label: '8', value: 92},
    {label: '10', value: 95},
  ]}
  yLabel="% of total insights"
  thresholdLabel="85%"
  thresholdValue={85}
/>

The number 5 is not arbitrary. It comes from decades of usability research: after 5 well-conducted interviews, the core patterns stabilize. More interviews refine the nuances but rarely change the fundamental findings.

## Step 3. Findings synthesis

*Estimated duration: 1-2 sessions of 3-4 hours with the full team*

Synthesis is the moment when collected information becomes knowledge. The team meets with all notes, transcripts, and impressions from the interviews and works together to identify patterns, tensions, and the real problem emerging from the body of data.

This phase is hard. There's contradictory information. There are findings that don't fit with prior hypotheses. There are moments of frustration when it seems like each interviewee lives a different problem. That's normal. The real problem usually appears when you find the patterns that connect the differences, not those that ignore them.

### The Synthesis Board

The Synthesis Board is the central artifact of this phase. It's a visual map where the team places individual findings and groups them by patterns. It can be done on a physical whiteboard, in Miro, FigJam, or any tool that allows collaborative visual manipulation. What matters is not the tool but three principles:

1. **It's built together.** One person doesn't do it and present it to the rest. Everyone participates in placing findings and discussing groupings.
2. **Start with data, not categories.** First place the individual findings. Then look for patterns. If you start with categories, you fall into confirmation bias.
3. **Outliers are respected.** A finding that doesn't fit any pattern is not discarded. It's placed aside and kept visible. Sometimes the outlier is the most important signal.

### Synthesis techniques

| Technique | What it does | When to use it | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Affinity map** | Group findings by thematic similarity. | Inductive discovery when there's lots of diverse data. | *Works poorly when the team groups by pre-existing categories instead of letting patterns emerge.* |
| **Jobs To Be Done** | Identify the "job" the user is trying to do and where it fails. | Problems where the person has a clear goal but can't reach it. | *Requires understanding of the functional, social, and emotional context of the "job".* |
| **Empathy map** | Organize what the person says, thinks, does, and feels. | Capturing the emotional dimension of the problem. | *Useful as a complement, not as a primary synthesis technique.* |
| **5 Whys analysis** | Reach the root cause by repeatedly asking "why." | When symptoms are clear but causes aren't. | *Don't force exactly 5 levels. The goal is the root cause, not the number.* |
| **Contextual observation** | Observe the user in their real environment while they do their work. | When the problem is process-related and interviews don't capture it well. | *Consumes more time but reveals behaviors that interviews don't show.* |

### The synthesis question

At the end of synthesis, the team must be able to answer a single question: **"What is the real problem these people live, expressed so that anyone in the organization would understand it the same way?"**

If you can't answer this question with a single clear sentence, the synthesis isn't finished.

## Step 4. Drafting and validating the Problem Statement

*Estimated duration: 1-2 days of drafting + 2-3 days of validation*

The Problem Statement is the final deliverable of this phase and one of the most important documents in the entire methodology. It's not a summary of the discovery. It's a distillation: the clearest, most concise, and most precise expression of the real problem the team has discovered.

### The Validation Radar

A validated problem must score high across multiple dimensions. Comparing a **validated profile** against a **risky assumption** reveals the typical failure pattern: high business viability but low user resonance.

<RadarChart
  axes={['Resonance', 'Frequency', 'Will. to Pay', 'Biz Viability', 'Tech Feasib.']}
  datasets={[
    {label: 'Validated Problem', values: [90, 85, 80, 95, 90], color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
    {label: 'Risky Assumption', values: [30, 40, 20, 80, 60], color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
  ]}
/>

The radar makes visible what intuition hides. A problem that scores 90 on Business Viability but 30 on User Resonance is not a validated problem. It is a business hypothesis disguised as a user need.
