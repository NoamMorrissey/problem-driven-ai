# 5. Market phase

## The market as a permanent teacher

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 5. While the [methodology section](/phases/market-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.

### Phase artifacts

- **Signal Log** — Structured record of market signals with source, hypothesis, and urgency
- **Context Update Record** — Traceability between market signals and context changes
- **Iteration Brief** — Cycle learnings, Context Document state, next cycle focus
- **KPI Dashboard** — Real-time KPI movement visualization with alerts
- **Context Document (living version)** — Updated project-context.md, PRD, Story Files, and KPI Register
