# 5. Market phase

## The market as a permanent teacher

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 5. While the [methodology section](/phases/market-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.

## The Market Phase workflow

Market Phase operates as a system of nested loops with different cadences: the innermost captures signals continuously and automatically, the middle one interprets them weekly and monthly, and the outermost reviews strategy quarterly. The five steps ensure that market learning produces tangible action: each signal is captured, interpreted, updates the Context Document with full traceability, and feeds the next cycle through the Iteration Brief.

### Phase artifacts

This phase produces five artifacts that operate as an integrated system: signals are captured, interpreted, update the Context Document with full traceability, and feed the next cycle through the Iteration Brief.

1. **Signal Log** — Structured record of market signals: observed signal, source, level (1-5), cause hypothesis, affected Context Document element, urgency, proposed action, and status.
   **Format:** Structured log with template (Google Sheets).
   **Built by:** Product Lead + Data Lead. Continuous and weekly-monthly feeding.

2. **Context Update Record** — Traceability between signals and Context Document changes: source signals, validated hypothesis, modified element, change (before/after/justification), approved by, impact.
   **Format:** Chronological log with template (spreadsheet).
   **Built by:** Context Engineer. Generated with every Context Document change.

3. **Iteration Brief** — Document closing the cycle: what was learned, Context Document state, open questions, next cycle focus, priority KPIs.
   **Format:** Structured document with template (Google Docs).
   **Built by:** Product Lead with team input. Monthly or quarterly cadence.

4. **KPI Dashboard** — Real-time KPI movement visualization with automatic alerts when defined thresholds are crossed.
   **Format:** Dashboard connected to verified sources (Looker, Metabase, Google Sheets).
   **Built by:** Data Lead. Automatic real-time updates.

5. **Context Document (living version)** — project-context.md, PRD, Story Files, and KPI Register continuously updated based on market signals.
   **Format:** Markdown files (same structure as Phases 3-4).
   **Built by:** Context Engineer + Product Lead. Continuous updates.
