# 5. Market phase

## The market as a permanent teacher

This section contains the operational guide for executing Phase 5. While the [methodology section](/phases/market-phase) explains the why and the concepts, this guide details the **how**: the concrete steps, templates, artifacts, and validation criteria.

### The process in five steps

| Step | Name | Main output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Measurement system activation** | KPIs connected, Signal Log operational, dashboards active |
| 2 | **Signal capture** | Signal Log continuously fed by 3 layers |
| 3 | **Signal interpretation** | Classified signals with validated cause hypotheses |
| 4 | **Context Document update** | Context Update Record with full traceability |
| 5 | **Iteration Brief** | Documented bridge between learning cycles |

### Phase artifacts

- **Signal Log** — Structured record of market signals with source, hypothesis, and urgency
- **Context Update Record** — Traceability between market signals and context changes
- **Iteration Brief** — Cycle learnings, Context Document state, next cycle focus
- **KPI Dashboard** — Real-time KPI movement visualization with alerts
- **Context Document (living version)** — Updated project-context.md, PRD, Story Files, and KPI Register
