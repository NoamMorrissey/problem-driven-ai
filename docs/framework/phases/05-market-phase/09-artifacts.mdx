</div>

Phase 5 produces five artifacts that operate as an integrated system. None has value in isolation — their power lies in the connections between them: Signal Log signals feed the Context Update Record, which documents Context Document changes, which are summarized in the Iteration Brief, which defines the next cycle's focus.

| Artifact | Format | Built by |
|---|---|---|
| **Signal Log** | Structured log with template (Google Sheets) | Product Lead + Data Lead |
| **Context Update Record** | Chronological log with template (spreadsheet) | Context Engineer |
| **Iteration Brief** | Structured document with template (Google Docs) | Product Lead with team input |
| **KPI Dashboard** | Dashboard connected to verified sources (Looker, Metabase, Google Sheets) | Data Lead |
| **Context Document (living)** | Markdown files (same structure as Phases 3-4) | Context Engineer + Product Lead |

## Creation sequence

```
Go-live
  │
  ├─→ KPI Dashboard (day 1)
  ├─→ Signal Log (day 1)
  │
  │   [Weeks 1-4: intensive capture and analysis]
  │
  ├─→ Context Update Record (first update)
  │
  │   [Week 4: first cycle close]
  │
  └─→ First Iteration Brief
```

After the first cycle, artifacts are continuously fed according to the three iteration cycle loop cadences.

---

## 1. Signal Log

Phase 5's central artifact. It is the market's memory.

- **Format:** Structured log with template (Google Sheets).
- **Built by:** Product Lead + Data Lead. Continuous feeding (automatic layer), weekly-monthly (structured and contextual layers).
- **When it's created:** At measurement system activation (day 1).

### Entry structure

```
## Signal #[NNN] — [Date]

**Observed signal:** [Raw data description, no interpretation]
**Source and method:** [analytics | interview | KPI | ticket | external signal]
**Signal level:** [1-Behavior | 2-KPI | 3-Feedback | 4-Non-usage | 5-External]

**Cause hypothesis:** [Formulated as a verifiable hypothesis]
**Affected Context Document element:**
  [Problem Statement | Solution Brief | Rule | Story File | KPI]

**Urgency:** [Immediate | Normal | Strategic]
**Proposed action:** [Action description and return phase if applicable]

**Status:** [New | Under analysis | Processed → CUR-NNN | Discarded (reason)]
```

### Best practices

- Separate observation from interpretation. The "observed signal" field never contains conclusions.
- Every signal has at least one cause hypothesis, even if preliminary.
- Discarded signals are kept with documented reason — they may be relevant in another cycle.
- Link related signals to detect emerging patterns.

## 2. Context Update Record

The traceability between market and context. In twelve months, it allows reconstructing **why** the Context Document is the way it is.

- **Format:** Chronological log with template (spreadsheet).
- **Built by:** Context Engineer. Generated with every Context Document change.
- **When it's created:** At the first Context Document update.

### Entry structure

```
## CUR-[NNN] — [Date]

**Source signal(s):** Signal Log #[NNN], #[NNN]
**Validated cause hypothesis:** [Description of confirmed root cause]

**Modified element:** [Problem Statement | Solution Brief | Rule | Story File | PRD | KPI]
**Change made:**
  - Before: [Previous state]
  - After: [New state]
  - Justification: [Why this change responds to the signal]

**Approved by:** [Name, role]
**Impact on other elements:** [None | List of affected elements]
```

:::tip[Why traceability matters]
In six months, new team members can understand why each Rule exists. In regulated environments (banking, healthcare), this traceability is an audit requirement, not an optional best practice.

## 3. Iteration Brief

The bridge between cycles. Without it, each cycle starts from zero instead of where the previous one ended.

- **Format:** Structured document with template (Google Docs).
- **Built by:** Product Lead with team input. Monthly or quarterly cadence depending on maturity.
- **When it's created:** At the start of each iteration cycle.

### Structure

```
## Iteration Brief — Cycle [N] → Cycle [N+1]
## Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### 1. Previous cycle learnings
[List of significant signals with Signal Log references]
- Confirmed assumptions: [list]
- Refuted assumptions: [list]

### 2. Context Document state
[Update summary with Context Update Record references]
- Modified Rules: [N]
- Adjusted Story Files: [N]
- Problem Statement: [No changes | Minor revision | Major revision]

### 3. Open questions
[Unverified hypotheses, weak signals that could be important]

### 4. Next cycle focus
[What aspect deserves more attention and why]
[Return phase if applicable: Phase 1 / 2 / 3 / 4]

### 5. Priority KPIs
[Indicators to watch and why they're most relevant]
```

---

## 4. KPI Dashboard

The continuous window into the system's market state. It's the first place the team looks each morning.

- **Format:** Dashboard connected to verified sources (Looker, Metabase, Google Sheets).
- **Built by:** Data Lead. Automatic real-time updates.
- **When it's created:** At measurement system activation (day 1).

### Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| **Connected to verified sources** | Each KPI connected to the data source defined in Phase 3's KPI & OKR Register. |
| **Real-time updates** | No manual intervention for automatic layer data. |
| **Visible thresholds** | Each KPI shows the target, alert threshold, and current state. |
| **Automatic alerts** | Notification when a KPI crosses the alert threshold. |
| **Accessible history** | Visible trend for detecting gradual movements that don't cross thresholds. |

---

## 5. Context Document (living version)

The most valuable asset the system produces. As Phase 5 progresses, it becomes the deepest knowledge available about the problem and solution in their real context.

- **Format:** Markdown files (same structure as Phases 3-4).
- **Built by:** Context Engineer + Product Lead. Continuous updates based on market signals.
- **When it's created:** Inherited from Phases 3 and 4.

### Updated components

| Component | What gets updated in Phase 5 |
|---|---|
| **project-context.md** | Rules modified, added, or removed based on market signals. |
| **PRD** | Use cases adjusted with real adoption learnings. |
| **Story Files** | Skills adjusted or new ones created for emerging needs. |
| **KPI & OKR Register** | KPIs recalibrated, new indicators added, obsolete ones retired. |

:::warning[The Context Document as an asset]
A mature Context Document — one that has survived twelve months of Market Phase — contains the deepest understanding available. It is transferable (new members understand in days), extensible (foundation for new markets), and auditable (every decision has traceability).
