# Exit criteria: the Gate Review

:::caution[Gate 2 → 3: Passage conditions]
- The Solution Brief is complete with all eight sections and has been signed or explicitly approved by all relevant internal stakeholders.
- The solution has been validated with clients/users and they confirm it solves their problem.
- The Decision Matrix is documented with weighted criteria fixed before evaluation.
- The Assumptions Register is complete. High-risk assumptions have been verified or have a documented contingency plan.
- The Feedback Log is closed: all received feedback has been incorporated or discarded with justification.
- The Translatability Map has been reviewed and there are no dimensions with insufficient definition for Context Engineering.
- The Corridor Consensus Test has been passed: each stakeholder can explain what will be built and why, consistently.

**Do not advance if:**
- Approval is only hierarchical and there is no real understanding of the solution by stakeholders.
- There are unresolved and undocumented disagreements.
- The Solution Brief has unverified high-risk assumptions without a contingency plan.
