# Duration and effort

| Scenario | Duration | What it includes |
|---|---|---|
| **Scoped solution, few stakeholders** | 1-2 weeks | 1 divergence session + 1 structuring + 1 convergence + 1-2 validation rounds. |
| **Medium solution, multiple stakeholders** | 2-4 weeks | 2 divergence sessions + 2 structuring with complete trees + 1-2 convergence + 2-3 client validation rounds + 2-3 internal alignment. |
| **Complex solution, organizational impact** | 4-8 weeks | Extensive divergence + deep structuring across 4 dimensions + critical assumption verification + multiple validation rounds + formal organizational consensus + Pre-Execution Scorecard. |

**General rule:** if the Solution Alignment phase takes less time than Problem Discovery, you're probably underestimating the complexity of consensus. If it takes more than double, you're probably over-analyzing or have an organizational alignment problem that this phase cannot solve.
