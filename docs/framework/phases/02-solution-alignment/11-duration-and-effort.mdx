# Effort

Solution Alignment is not measured in calendar weeks. It's measured by the depth of consensus achieved and the rigor with which alternatives have been explored, structured, and validated.

## Effort by complexity

| Scenario | Required activities | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| **Scoped solution, few stakeholders** | 1 divergence session + 1 structuring + 1 convergence + 1-2 validation rounds. | Alternatives are few and clear. Consensus is reached within one iteration cycle. |
| **Medium solution, multiple stakeholders** | 2 divergence sessions + 2 structuring with complete trees + 1-2 convergence + 2-3 client validation rounds + 2-3 internal alignment. | Alternatives require deep exploration across all 4 dimensions. Consensus requires multiple iterations with different groups. |
| **Complex solution, organizational impact** | Extensive divergence + deep structuring across 4 dimensions + critical assumption verification + multiple validation rounds + formal organizational consensus + Pre-Execution Scorecard. | Each dimension has ramifications affecting multiple stakeholders. Consensus requires formal, documented alignment. |

:::tip[Alignment effort is not proportional to discovery effort]
If the effort invested in Solution Alignment is significantly less than that invested in Problem Discovery, you're probably underestimating the complexity of consensus. If it's more than double, you're probably over-analyzing or have an organizational alignment problem that this phase cannot solve.
