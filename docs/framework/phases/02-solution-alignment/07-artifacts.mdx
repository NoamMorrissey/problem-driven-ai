# The artifacts of this phase

| Artifact | When it's created | What it contains | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ideation Board** | Built in Step 1 (Divergence). | Visual record of all generated solutions, grouped and with notes on why non-selected ones were discarded. | Memory of explored options. Prevents the team from reinventing what it already discarded with reason. |
| **Solution Trees** | Built in Step 2 (Structuring). | Decomposition of each candidate solution across the four dimensions: business, model, architecture, data. | Make visible the real complexity of each solution. Reveal gaps and dependencies that the abstract idea doesn't show. |
| **Assumptions Register** | Started in Step 2 and updated throughout the process. | Classified list of all assumptions: verified, low risk, high risk, unknown. With action plan for high-risk ones. | Assumptions are invisible risk. This register makes them visible and manageable. |
| **Decision Matrix** | Built in Step 3 (Convergence). | Evaluation of candidate solutions against weighted criteria: impact, technical viability, business viability, assumption risk, adoption friction. | Makes explicit the reasons for the choice. Prevents the decision from being made by intuition, politics, or authority. |
| **Feedback Log** | Started in Step 4 and updated in Step 5. | Cumulative record of all client and stakeholder feedback: who said it, what they said, how it was incorporated or why it was discarded. | Total traceability of the alignment process. If someone asks "why was this chosen," the answer is here. |
| **Solution Brief** | Written after Step 5 when consensus exists. | The most important document of this phase: problem it solves, solution description, decisions made and justifications, active assumptions, agreed success criteria, constraints, actors, Scorecard by dimensions. | It's the entry document to Phase 3 (Context Engineering). Everything the AI does afterwards is based on this document. |
