  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={1} title="Permission Disguised as Consensus">
    **What it is:** The most common and most destructive anti-pattern of this phase. A director says "go ahead" in a meeting without having read the Solution Brief, without understanding the assumptions, and without committing to defending the solution when problems arise. The team interprets this as consensus and moves forward.

    **How to detect it:** The Corridor Consensus Test fails. The stakeholder who "approved" cannot explain what will be built or why.

    **How to prevent it:** Don't accept approval without understanding. If a stakeholder cannot explain the solution, they haven't given consensus. They've given permission. Ask each stakeholder to articulate in their own words what will be built and what will change.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={2} title="Solution Seeking a Problem">
    **What it is:** The team arrives at Phase 2 with a technology or solution they want to implement and adjusts the Problem Statement to justify it. "We want to use RAG" becomes the premise and the problem is reformulated so RAG is the answer.

    **How to detect it:** The chosen solution is the first one proposed. The Decision Matrix confirms the pre-existing preference. Alternatives were superficially discarded.

    **How to prevent it:** Mandatorily include at least one candidate solution that doesn't use AI. If the AI solution wins, let it be because it solved the problem better, not because the team wanted to use it.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={3} title="The Missing Decomposition">
    **What it is:** The team chooses a solution without decomposing it by dimensions. The idea sounds good in the abstract but nobody has examined whether the data exists, whether the architecture is viable, whether the business model works.

    **How to detect it:** There's no Solution Tree. The four dimensions aren't covered. The question "where does the data come from?" produces silence.

    **How to prevent it:** Don't allow convergence (Step 3) without structuring (Step 2). The Decision Matrix can only be evaluated on solutions that have been decomposed. Abstract ideas are not evaluated.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={4} title="Consensus Scope Creep">
    **What it is:** To achieve agreement from all stakeholders, the solution keeps expanding to include each person's requests. What started as a precise solution to a defined problem becomes a platform that tries to solve everything.

    **How to detect it:** The Solution Brief is significantly broader than the Problem Statement it was supposed to solve. Success criteria have multiplied. There are features that don't map to any part of the original problem.

    **How to prevent it:** Every proposed feature must pass the "Problem Statement test": does this directly solve any element of the problem defined in Phase 1? If not, it goes to the future backlog, not the Solution Brief.
  </AntiPatternAccordionItem>
  <AntiPatternAccordionItem number={5} title="The Forgotten Dimension">
    **What it is:** The team structures the solution across three of the four dimensions and ignores the fourth. Typically, what gets forgotten is data ("we'll worry about that later") or business ("the ROI is obvious").

    **How to detect it:** One branch of the Solution Tree is empty or has a single generic line. Especially dangerous when it's the data branch in an AI project.

    **How to prevent it:** Mandatory checklist: all four dimensions must have at least three lines of detail each before moving to convergence. If a dimension cannot be completed, that in itself is a critical finding that must be documented as a high-risk assumption.

## Quick reference

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Root cause | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Permission Disguised as Consensus** | Stakeholder can't explain the solution | Approval without understanding | Each stakeholder must articulate what and why |
| **Solution Seeking a Problem** | Chosen solution was first proposed; alternatives discarded | Technology preference before problem analysis | Include at least one non-AI candidate solution |
| **Missing Decomposition** | No Solution Tree; "where does data come from?" produces silence | Converging on abstract ideas | No convergence without structuring across 4 dimensions |
| **Consensus Scope Creep** | Solution Brief broader than Problem Statement | Expanding to accommodate every stakeholder | Every feature must pass the "Problem Statement test" |
| **Forgotten Dimension** | Empty branch in the Solution Tree | Ignoring data or business dimensions | Mandatory checklist: 4 dimensions, 3+ lines each |
