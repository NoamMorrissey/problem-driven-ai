# 2. Solution phase

This is the operational guide for executing Solution Phase — the phase where the team finds, structures, and aligns on the right solution before building anything. While the [methodology section](/phases/solution-phase) explains the *why* and the conceptual foundations, this guide covers the *how*: the concrete process to follow, the artifacts to produce, the criteria to meet before moving forward, and the failure patterns to watch for.

## The Solution Phase workflow

Solution Phase structures in five steps the path from idea to shared mandate. The first three (Divergence, Structuring, Convergence) are intellectual work: generating options, decomposing them, and selecting with explicit criteria. The last two (Client validation, Internal stakeholder validation) are alignment work: confirming that the solution solves the real problem and that the entire organization understands it the same way. The Solution Brief packages everything for transfer to Phase 3.

## The six artifacts

This phase produces six artifacts that together form the foundation for Phase 3. The first three capture the intellectual work of generating and evaluating solutions. The last three record validation and package everything for transfer.

1. **Ideation Board** — Visual record of all generated solutions, grouped, with notes on why non-selected ones were discarded. Organizational memory that prevents reinventing what was already evaluated.
   **Format:** Collaborative visual board (Miro, FigJam, post-its).
   **Built by:** The full team during Divergence.

2. **Solution Trees** — Decomposition of each candidate solution across the four dimensions: business, model, architecture, data. Make visible the complexity that abstract ideas hide.
   **Format:** Collaborative visual board or structured document.
   **Built by:** The team during Structuring.

3. **Assumptions Register** — Classified list of all assumptions: verified, low risk, high risk, unknown. With action plans for high-risk ones.
   **Format:** Table (Google Sheets).
   **Built by:** The team. Started during Structuring and updated at each step.

4. **Decision Matrix** — Evaluation of candidate solutions against weighted criteria fixed before scoring. Makes explicit the reasons for the choice.
   **Format:** Table with 1-5 scores and weights per criterion (Google Sheets).
   **Built by:** The team during Convergence. Weights set by the Decision Owner.

5. **Feedback Log** — Cumulative record of all client and stakeholder feedback: who said what, how it was incorporated or why it was discarded.
   **Format:** Chronological log (Google Docs, spreadsheet).
   **Built by:** The facilitator during external and internal validation.

6. **Solution Brief** — Entry document to Phase 3: problem it solves, proposed solution, decisions and justifications, dimension decomposition, active assumptions, success criteria, constraints, and Translatability Map.
   **Format:** Structured document in 8 sections (Google Docs).
   **Built by:** PM / Product Owner with team input.

## What this guide covers

<DocCardList />

:::tip The investment in consensus pays for itself
This phase is the hinge between pure human thinking (Phase 1) and the translation of that thinking into language the AI can process (Phase 3). Everything done poorly here is exponentially amplified when context reaches the AI. A well-aligned solution produces precise context. An ambiguous solution produces context that looks correct but doesn't solve what it was supposed to solve.
