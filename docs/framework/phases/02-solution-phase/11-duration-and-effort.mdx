# Effort

Solution Phase is not measured in calendar weeks. It's measured by the depth of consensus achieved and the rigor with which alternatives have been explored, structured, and validated.

## Effort by complexity

| Scenario | Required activities | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| **Scoped solution, few stakeholders** | 1 divergence session + 1 structuring + 1 convergence + 1-2 validation rounds. | Alternatives are few and clear. Consensus is reached within one iteration cycle. |
| **Medium solution, multiple stakeholders** | 2 divergence sessions + 2 structuring with complete trees + 1-2 convergence + 2-3 client validation rounds + 2-3 internal alignment. | Alternatives require deep exploration across all 4 dimensions. Consensus requires multiple iterations with different groups. |
| **Complex solution, organizational impact** | Extensive divergence + deep structuring across 4 dimensions + critical assumption verification + multiple validation rounds + formal organizational consensus + Pre-Execution Scorecard. | Each dimension has ramifications affecting multiple stakeholders. Consensus requires formal, documented alignment. |

## Effort allocation

A healthy Alignment process dedicates significant effort to structuring and validation. Skipping structuring produces decisions based on intuition instead of analysis.

The most common mistake is spending 80% of the effort on ideation and convergence and 20% on everything else. The ratio should be closer to 30/70: **30% generating and choosing, 70% structuring, validating, and aligning**.

:::tip[Alignment effort is not proportional to discovery effort]
If the effort invested in Solution Phase is significantly less than that invested in Problem Phase, you're probably underestimating the complexity of consensus. If it's more than double, you're probably over-analyzing or have an organizational alignment problem that this phase cannot solve.
