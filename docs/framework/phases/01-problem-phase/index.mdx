# 1. Problem phase

This is the operational guide for executing Problem Phase — the phase where the team investigates the real problem before thinking about solutions. While the [methodology section](/phases/problem-phase) explains the *why* and the conceptual foundations, this guide covers the *how*: the concrete process to follow, the artifacts to produce, the criteria to meet before moving forward, and the failure patterns to watch for.

## The Problem Phase workflow

Problem Phase is a structured four-step process that guides the team from identifying a problem to its validated definition. Each step produces a deliverable that feeds the next: the kick-off establishes the actor map and hypotheses, the interviews generate raw findings, the synthesis converts those findings into patterns, and the Problem Statement distills everything into a definition that both users and the Decision Owner recognize as real. Discipline in the sequence is what differentiates a rigorous discovery from a well-intentioned conversation.

  {number: 4, title: '4. Problem Statement drafting and validation', description: 'Distillation of the problem into a half-page document. Dual validation: resonance with users and viability with the Decision Owner.', owner: 'Validated Problem Statement'},
]} />

## The four artifacts

This phase produces four artifacts that together form the foundation for Phase 2. Each one captures a distinct type of knowledge: who surrounds the problem, what questions to ask, what patterns emerge from listening, and what the distilled definition of the real problem is.

<ArtifactAccordion>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Actor Map">
    Visual map of everyone who touches the problem: who lives it, who decides whether it gets solved, who is affected by the solution, and who has information the team isn't seeing.

    **Format:** Collaborative visual board (Miro, FigJam, or physical whiteboard).

    **Built by:** The full team during the kick-off.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Interview Guide">
    Open question guide in four blocks (opening, exploration, depth, closing), including at least one question designed to challenge the team's main hypothesis.

    **Format:** Document (Google Docs).

    **Built by:** The team during the kick-off, after the Actor Map.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Synthesis Board">
    Visual map of anonymized findings grouped by patterns, with affinities, tensions, outliers, and hypotheses explicitly confirmed or refuted.

    **Format:** Collaborative visual board (Miro, FigJam, or physical whiteboard).

    **Built by:** The full team in the synthesis session.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>
  <ArtifactAccordionItem title="Problem Statement">
    Problem definition of no more than half a page with seven elements: the gap, the owner, the success criteria, the constraints, the actors, the temporal context, and the cost of inaction.

    **Format:** Half-page maximum document (Google Docs).

    **Built by:** The team. Validated by users and Decision Owner.
  </ArtifactAccordionItem>

## The cost of error

Why invest in Discovery? Because fixing a misunderstood problem in Production costs **100x more** than fixing it during Discovery. The earlier the error is caught, the cheaper the correction.

<CostChart bars={[
  {label: 'Discovery', value: '1x', height: 40, color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
  {label: 'Development', value: '10x', height: 130, color: 'var(--ifm-color-warning)'},
  {label: 'Production', value: '100x', height: 250, color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
]} />

This is not theory. It is the most consistent finding in software engineering research: **the cost of change grows exponentially with each phase**. Discovery is the cheapest moment to be wrong.

:::tip The investment that pays for itself
Every hour invested in properly understanding the problem saves weeks of misguided building, rework cycles, realignment meetings, and — above all — the erosion of trust that occurs when a team delivers something nobody needed. If you're dedicating less than 15% of the project's total time to Problem Phase, you're probably investing too little. The sweet spot is between 15% and 25%.
