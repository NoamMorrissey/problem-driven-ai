The Framework is the operational layer of Problem-Driven AI. While the methodology explains what each phase means and why it matters, the Framework tells you exactly how to execute it: step-by-step processes, artifact templates, gate reviews, anti-patterns to avoid, and effort estimates. It is the bridge between understanding the methodology and applying it in a real project.

Each card below links to the operational guide for one phase. These guides complement the conceptual content found in the [Methodology](/phases) section. Where Methodology answers *what is this phase?* and *why does it exist?*, the Framework answers *how do I execute it?*, *what artifacts do I produce?*, and *how do I know I'm done?*. Both layers cover the same five phases — start with Methodology to understand, move to Framework to execute.
