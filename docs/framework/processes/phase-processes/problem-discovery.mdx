# Product Discovery & Problem Validation

A rigorous process to transform assumptions into validated Problem Statements. The investment in Discovery is not optional: **it is the precondition for building something that deserves to exist**.

  <StatCard value="2x" label="Validation Loops" description="Users + Decision Owner" />
  <StatCard value="100%" label="Gate Review" description="All criteria must pass" />
</StatCardGrid>

## The Discovery workflow

This linear view represents the core path from identifying a problem to passing the final Gate Review. It requires coordination between the Facilitator, Researcher, and Decision Owner.

<ProcessTimeline steps={[
  {number: 1, title: '1. Setup & Hypotheses', description: 'Define scope, map actors, and document initial assumptions (and inverted hypotheses).', owner: 'Facilitator'},
  {number: 2, title: '2. Research Execution', description: 'Recruit minimum 5 candidates. Execute 45-60 min deep-dive interviews. Capture raw notes.', owner: 'Researcher'},
  {number: 3, title: '3. Synthesis & 5 Whys', description: 'Map findings to the Synthesis Board. Identify root causes vs symptoms using the 5 Whys technique.', owner: 'Facilitator'},
  {number: 4, title: '4. Dual Validation', description: 'Parallel tracks: validate Resonance with Users and Viability/Cost with the Decision Owner.', owner: 'Shared'},
  {number: 5, title: '5. Gate Review', description: 'Final checklist. If validated: proceed to Solution Alignment. If invalid: cancel or pivot.', owner: 'Facilitator'},
]} />

## Why 5 interviews?

Qualitative research adheres to the law of diminishing returns. By the 5th interview, approximately 85% of core problems and patterns are typically identified. Additional interviews add diminishing value.

<SaturationChart
  data={[
    {label: '1', value: 35},
    {label: '2', value: 55},
    {label: '3', value: 70},
    {label: '5', value: 85},
    {label: '8', value: 92},
    {label: '10', value: 95},
  ]}
  yLabel="% of total insights"
  thresholdLabel="85%"
  thresholdValue={85}
/>

The number 5 is not arbitrary. It comes from decades of usability research: after 5 well-conducted interviews, the core patterns stabilize. More interviews refine the nuances but rarely change the fundamental findings.

## Effort allocation

A healthy Discovery process is not just "talking to people." It requires significant effort in Synthesis and Validation to avoid confirmation bias.

<EffortChart segments={[
  {label: 'Setup & Recruitment', percent: 15, color: 'var(--pdai-gray-300)'},
  {label: 'Interview Execution', percent: 30, color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
  {label: 'Synthesis & Analysis', percent: 25, color: 'var(--ifm-color-warning)'},
  {label: 'Validation Loops', percent: 30, color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
]} />

The most common mistake is spending 80% of the effort on interviews and 20% on everything else. The ratio should be closer to 30/70: **30% gathering data, 70% making sense of it and validating it**.

## The Validation Radar

A validated problem must score high across multiple dimensions. Comparing a **validated profile** against a **risky assumption** reveals the typical failure pattern: high business viability but low user resonance.

<RadarChart
  axes={['Resonance', 'Frequency', 'Will. to Pay', 'Biz Viability', 'Tech Feasib.']}
  datasets={[
    {label: 'Validated Problem', values: [90, 85, 80, 95, 90], color: 'var(--ifm-color-primary)'},
    {label: 'Risky Assumption', values: [30, 40, 20, 80, 60], color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
  ]}
/>

The radar makes visible what intuition hides. A problem that scores 90 on Business Viability but 30 on User Resonance is not a validated problem. It is a business hypothesis disguised as a user need.

## The cost of error

Why invest in Discovery? Because fixing a misunderstood problem in Production costs **100x more** than fixing it during Discovery. The earlier the error is caught, the cheaper the correction.

<CostChart bars={[
  {label: 'Discovery', value: '1x', height: 40, color: 'var(--ifm-color-success)'},
  {label: 'Development', value: '10x', height: 130, color: 'var(--ifm-color-warning)'},
  {label: 'Production', value: '100x', height: 250, color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)'},
]} />

This is not theory. It is the most consistent finding in software engineering research: **the cost of change grows exponentially with each phase**. Discovery is the cheapest moment to be wrong.

## Gate Review checklist

Before proceeding to Solution Alignment, the Problem Statement must pass these conditions:

:::tip[Gate Review: passage conditions]
- Problem validated by 5+ real users
- Root cause identified (5 Whys applied)
- Cost/success criteria approved by Decision Owner
- No hypothesis contradictions remaining
- Problem Statement documented and signed off
:::

:::warning[Next step]
Only once the problem is validated beyond reasonable doubt: proceed to **Solution Alignment**.
