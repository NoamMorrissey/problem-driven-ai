# 10. Clarity is the only luxury you can't afford not to have

> In every phase of this methodology, clarity is the scarcest and most valuable resource.

## Statement

Clarity about the problem, about the solution, about the context, about the KPIs. Everything else can be imperfect. Clarity cannot. Clarity is not a state you arrive at — it's a discipline you practice in every decision, every document, every conversation.

## Why it matters

Ambiguity is the silent enemy of any project. It doesn't shout, doesn't announce itself — it simply seeps into every layer of the process until the results don't resemble what anyone expected. And then everyone wonders what went wrong.

In Problem-Driven AI, clarity is the cross-cutting metric that traverses all principles. A clear Problem Statement, a clear context, clear consensus, iterations with clear learnings. Clarity is not perfection: it's the ability to articulate what you know, what you don't know, and what you're assuming.

## Practical implications

- **Apply the clarity test** to every artifact: can someone external understand this without additional context?
- **Document what you DON'T know**: explicit unknowns are more valuable than implicit certainties.
- **Define clarity KPIs**: are objectives defined without ambiguity? Are success criteria measurable?
- **Make clarity a habit**: not a one-time event, but a continuous practice.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Comfortable Ambiguity

Deliberately maintaining vague definitions to avoid commitments or difficult decisions. "We'll figure it out as we go" as a strategy. Ambiguity becomes a comfort zone where nobody is responsible for anything concrete.

## Connections

- The cross-cutting metric across all previous principles.
- Applies as a quality criterion in every [Phase](../phases/index.mdx) of the lifecycle.
- Measured through the KPIs defined in the [Framework](/framework).
- Directly feeds [Context Engineering](../principles/04-context-engineering-es-diseno.mdx) as a precision requirement.
