# 04. Context Engineering is design, not writing

> Writing context for AI is not summarizing what you know. It's making deliberate decisions about what to include, what to exclude, how to structure, and what level of precision is needed for each element.

## Statement

Poor context produces poor results regardless of the model you use. Context Engineering is a design discipline that requires strategic thinking, not a writing exercise solved with good prose.

## Why it matters

The quality of any AI system's output is determined by the quality of its context. Not by the prompt. Not by the model. By the context. This inverts the usual equation: instead of looking for the most powerful model, look for the most precise context.

Context Engineering involves information architecture decisions: what data is relevant, in what order it should be presented, what level of detail each section needs, what is deliberately excluded to avoid noise. It's information design applied to AI.

## Practical implications

- **Treat context as a design artifact**: it has versions, iterations, and quality criteria.
- **Decide what to exclude**: what you leave out of the context is as important as what you include.
- **Structure before writing**: the organization of context precedes its writing.
- **Set precision levels**: not everything needs the same level of detail. Calibrate granularity per section.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Context Dump

Dumping all available information into the context without curation, structure, or prioritization. The equivalent of giving someone 200 pages of documentation and saying "it's all in there." More information is not better information.

## Connections

- Depends on [Organizational Consensus](/principles/sin-consenso-no-hay-contexto) as a prerequisite.
- Materialized in the [Framework](/framework) artifacts.
- Evolves according to [Principle 09: Context is a living asset](/principles/el-contexto-es-un-activo-vivo).
- Context quality is measured with [Clarity](/principles/la-claridad-es-el-unico-lujo) as the metric.
