# 03. Without organizational consensus there is no context

> You can't write precise context for AI if there's disagreement within your organization about the problem or solution.

## Statement

Consensus is not a *nice-to-have*. It's a **technical prerequisite**. Internal ambiguity becomes ambiguity in the output. If the business team says one thing, the technical team another, and the stakeholder something different, the context you build for AI will be a Frankenstein of contradictory visions.

## Why it matters

Context Engineering requires a single source of truth. When contradictory visions exist within the organization, the context inherits those contradictions. AI models don't resolve human disagreements: they amplify them.

Context built on internal disagreement produces outputs that appear coherent but satisfy no one, because they reflect a compromise between incompatible positions instead of a clear direction.

## Practical implications

- **Before writing a single line of context**, verify that stakeholders are aligned on the Problem Statement.
- **Hold explicit alignment sessions**: silent consensus is not consensus.
- **Document resolved disagreements**: they're as valuable as agreements, because they delimit what the context must NOT include.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Phantom Consensus

Assuming everyone agrees because nobody has said otherwise. Organizational silence is not consensus. It's latent ambiguity that will explode when results don't meet expectations that nobody articulated.

- Fed by the work done in [Principles 01](../principles/01-el-problema-es-sagrado.mdx) and [02](../principles/02-el-cliente-no-sabe-lo-que-quiere.mdx).
- Directly impacts scope definition and alignment.
