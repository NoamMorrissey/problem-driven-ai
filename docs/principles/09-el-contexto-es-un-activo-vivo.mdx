## Statement

Treating it as finished is the beginning of **context debt**. Context has its own lifecycle: it's born with the Problem Statement, grows with discovery, is refined with market validation, and matures with each iteration. Declaring it "done" is declaring that you've stopped learning.

## Why it matters

Context debt is the AI equivalent of technical debt: invisible at first, paralyzing at the end. Outdated context produces outputs that reflect a reality that no longer exists. And the worst part: the outputs seem correct because they're internally coherent, even though they're based on obsolete premises.

Context as a living asset requires governance: who updates it, when it's reviewed, what signals trigger an update, how changes are versioned.

## Practical implications

- **Version your context**: each significant change deserves a record of what changed and why.
- **Define update triggers**: market signals, team changes, new learnings, strategic pivots.
- **Audit context debt**: periodically review whether the context reflects the current reality of the project.
- **Assign ownership**: someone must be responsible for the health of the context.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Frozen Context

Writing the context once at the start of the project and never touching it again. The team continues using a context that reflects day-1 reality, while the project is on day 90. AI outputs are technically correct but strategically obsolete.

## Connections

- Natural evolution of [Principle 04: Context Engineering is design](../principles/04-context-engineering-es-diseno.mdx).
- Updated with signals from [Principle 07: The market always knows more](../principles/07-el-mercado-siempre-sabe-mas.mdx).
- Each [Iteration](../principles/08-iterar-no-es-repetir.mdx) is an opportunity for updates.
- Managed through the [Framework](/framework) artifacts.
