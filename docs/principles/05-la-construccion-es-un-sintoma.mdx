## Statement

A team that celebrates having built fast without validating the problem is celebrating in the wrong direction. Building should be the inevitable consequence of a well-understood problem, a well-designed context, and solid organizational consensus.

## Why it matters

The tech industry has fetishized building. "Shipping" has become a success metric in itself. But delivering something nobody needs is not an achievement — it's waste with a due date.

In Problem-Driven AI, building is an indicator that the prior work was done correctly. If you need to build to discover you were heading in the wrong direction, the failure isn't in the building: it's in everything you didn't do before building.

## Practical implications

- **Don't measure progress by lines of code** or features delivered. Measure by validated problems.
- **Delay building** until you have clarity about the problem and the context.
- **Question the urgency to build**: if the team wants to "start building now", ask what is known about the problem.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Build-First Bias

**What it is.** Jumping directly to implementation because "we already know what needs to be done." Building speed becomes the primary metric, eclipsing problem validation and context quality.

**How to detect it.** The team has a working prototype but no validated Problem Statement. Sprint planning happens before any stakeholder interview. "How fast can we ship it?" is asked before "Are we solving the right problem?" The team celebrates lines of code committed, not hypotheses validated.

**How to prevent it.** Establish Phase 1 and Phase 2 as non-negotiable prerequisites before any construction. Make the Problem Statement and Solution Brief Gate Reviews mandatory. Measure progress in validated learnings, not in features delivered.
