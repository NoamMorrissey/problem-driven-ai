## Statement

Using AI to go fast without having invested in thinking is like running faster in the wrong direction. Legitimate speed emerges when the Problem Statement is precise, the context is well-designed, and the team has consensus. Any other speed is an illusion.

## Why it matters

AI has created an illusion of infinite speed. You can generate code, content, and prototypes in minutes. But speed without direction is not productivity: it's accelerated entropy.

Real speed in Problem-Driven AI is a **reward** the system grants you when you've invested the right effort in the prior phases. It's not something you can demand or shortcut. It's the natural consequence of clarity.

## Practical implications

- **Don't use "AI makes it fast"** as justification for skipping phases.
- **Measure net speed**, not gross: include the rework, corrections, and pivots caused by rushing.
- **Celebrate speed only when it comes with validation**: going fast in the right direction is the only type of speed that counts.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Speed Theater

Using AI generation speed as a productivity metric. Generating 10 versions in an hour seems productive, but if none of them solve the real problem, it's speed theater.

## Connections

- Inseparable pair with [Principle 05: Building is a symptom](../principles/05-la-construccion-es-un-sintoma.mdx).
- Legitimate speed requires the prior work of principles [01](../principles/01-el-problema-es-sagrado.mdx) through [04](../principles/04-context-engineering-es-diseno.mdx).
- Measured and validated in the [Phases](../phases/index.mdx) of iteration and delivery.
