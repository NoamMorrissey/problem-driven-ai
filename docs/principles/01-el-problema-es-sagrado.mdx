# 01. The problem is sacred

> Never assume you understand the problem. The real problem is rarely the one presented to you in the first conversation.

## Statement

You have to earn your understanding of the problem through **active listening**, **observation**, and **uncomfortable questions**. A misunderstood problem contaminates everything that follows, without exception.

## Why it matters

The Problem Statement is the foundation of the entire methodology. If the foundation is crooked, the whole structure tilts. It doesn't matter how sophisticated your Context Engineering is or how powerful the AI model you use: garbage in, garbage out.

The temptation to assume "we already understand" is the most expensive mistake in a project's lifecycle. Every minute invested in understanding the real problem saves hours of building in the wrong direction.

## Practical implications

- **Before writing any context**, validate that the problem you have documented is the real problem, not the symptom.
- **Ask uncomfortable questions**: if nobody feels uncomfortable, you probably aren't going deep enough.
- **Document the problem's evolution**: the Problem Statement isn't born perfect — it's discovered progressively.

:::danger Anti-pattern: The Inherited Problem Statement

Accepting the problem as handed to you by the client without questioning, challenging, or deepening it. Typically sounds like: *"The client already told us what they need, we just have to build it."*

## Connections

- Applies directly in the [Discovery Phase](../phases/index.mdx) as the mandatory first step.
- Feeds [Context Engineering](../principles/04-context-engineering-es-diseno.mdx) with its fundamental raw material.
- Validated against [Principle 02: The client doesn't know what they want](../principles/02-el-cliente-no-sabe-lo-que-quiere.mdx).
