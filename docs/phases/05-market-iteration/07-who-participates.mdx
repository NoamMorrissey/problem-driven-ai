# Who participates and when

Phase 5 is not a technical phase nor exclusive to the product team. It's the continuation of the organizational consensus built in Phase 2. The stakeholders who signed the Solution Brief don't disconnect after go-live — their participation is what keeps iteration connected to organizational priorities.

## Key roles

| Role | Responsibility in Phase 5 | Approximate dedication |
|---|---|---|
| **Product Lead** | Signal interpretation. Response prioritization. Iteration Brief writing. Decision on which signals to escalate to strategic review. | 20-60% depending on cycle moment |
| **Context Engineer** | Context Document owner. Executes updates. Maintains the Context Update Record. Configures and supervises synthesis agents. | 20-40% depending on cycle moment |
| **Data Lead** | Design and maintenance of the measurement system. Connection between KPIs and data sources. Dashboard quality. | 10-20% ongoing |
| **Stakeholders from Phases 1-2** | Quarterly strategic review. Validation that market signals are interpreted in the context of the original problem. Approval of changes to Problem Statement or Solution Brief. | Monthly (synthesis session) + quarterly (strategic review) |
| **Support / Sales** | Qualitative signal channel. Direct user feedback. Ticket and complaint patterns not captured in automated data. | Continuous (capture) + monthly (synthesis session) |

## Phase 5 sessions

Signal interpretation cannot be done individually. Market signals are best read when people with different perspectives — technical, business, user — analyze them together.

### Weekly KPI and behavior review

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cadence** | Weekly. 45-60 minutes. |
| **Participants** | Product Lead + Data Lead + Context Engineer. |
| **Focus** | Are KPIs moving as expected? Are there anomalous behavior patterns in the last week? |
| **Output** | Classified signals with cause hypotheses. Decision: process in the next iteration or escalate to monthly review. |

### Monthly qualitative feedback synthesis

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cadence** | Monthly. 2-3 hours. |
| **Participants** | Product Lead + Context Engineer + support/sales representative + 1-2 stakeholders from Phases 1-2. |
| **Focus** | What are users saying and doing that isn't captured in automated data? Are there feedback patterns signaling a definition problem? |
| **Output** | Updated Signal Log with qualitative findings. Signals classified by type of affected assumption. |

### Quarterly strategic review

| | |
|---|---|
| **Cadence** | Quarterly. Half a day. |
| **Participants** | Full team + key stakeholders from Phases 1 and 2. |
| **Focus** | Is the Problem Statement still correct? Is the solution still right for the market as it has evolved? What have we learned that we didn't know at launch? |
| **Output** | Next cycle's Iteration Brief. Explicit decision on whether to return to Phase 1, 2, 3, or 4. |

:::danger[Anti-pattern: analysis parallel to the business]
The product team analyzes market signals in parallel to the business. Stakeholders who signed the Solution Brief don't participate in interpretation. The product team's conclusions don't connect with organizational priorities.

**How to detect it:** The Iteration Brief proposes changes that business stakeholders question. There are signals the product team sees clearly but the organization doesn't act on.

**How to prevent it:** Stakeholders from Phases 1 and 2 participate in the monthly synthesis session and quarterly strategic review.

## Intensity varies with maturity

| Cycle moment | Intensity | Main activities |
|---|---|---|
| **First 4-8 weeks** post-launch | High | Daily KPI review. Weekly interviews. Very active Signal Log. First Iteration Brief. |
| **2-6 months** post-launch | Medium-high | Weekly KPI review. Monthly interviews. Monthly synthesis. Monthly Iteration Briefs. |
| **6-18 months** post-launch | Medium | Automated KPIs. Monthly interviews. Quarterly strategic review. |
| **18+ months** post-launch | Low-medium with peaks | Automatic monitoring. Monthly synthesis. Quarterly or semi-annual review. 30-40% peaks during strategic reviews that produce returns to Phases 1-2. |

:::tip[General rule]
Intensity is inversely proportional to context maturity. Phase 5 requires more human effort when the Context Document is less precise. As it incorporates market learnings, automation absorbs more of the routine work and human effort shifts toward strategic decisions.
