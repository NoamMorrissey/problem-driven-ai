# What Problem Phase is and what it isn't

Most failures in this phase don't come from doing it poorly, but from confusing it with something else.

## What it IS

- **An active investigation.** The team goes out to seek information it doesn't have. It talks to real people. Observes real behaviors. Collects data that challenges its prior assumptions.
- **A listening process, not a presentation.** The team comes to learn, not to share what it already knows. The ratio of talking to listening should be, at minimum, 20/80.
- **An exercise in precision.** The result is not a list of problems or a generic pain map. It's a single problem definition — concise, validated, and shared.
- **A collaborative effort.** One person doesn't do it. The team does. The synthesis is built together, not in an office.
- **A commitment to truth.** If the data contradicts the hypothesis you brought in, the data wins. Always.

## What it is NOT

- **It's not a kickoff meeting.** A kickoff is an administrative act. Discovery is an act of thinking.
- **It's not a client briefing.** The briefing is what the client thinks they need. Discovery is what they actually need. Often these are very different things.
- **It's not a validation process.** If you enter discovery with the answer and seek confirmation, you're not doing discovery. You're doing organized bias.
- **It's not a Design Thinking workshop.** Workshops are a possible tool within discovery, but discovery is not reducible to a workshop. It's a process that takes days or weeks, not hours.
- **It's not optional.** In this methodology, skipping discovery isn't going faster. It's building blind.

:::danger Anti-pattern: Decorative Discovery
**What it is:** The team conducts two interviews, confirms what it already believed, and writes a Problem Statement that appeared to be drafted before talking to anyone. The interviews were used as decoration, not as a source of truth.

**How to detect it:** If the final Problem Statement is identical to the starting hypothesis, something went wrong. A discovery that doesn't change anything you believed going in probably wasn't a discovery.

**How to prevent it:** Before starting interviews, write down your current hypothesis of the problem. After completing synthesis, compare it with the resulting Problem Statement. If there are no significant differences, it's not evidence that your hypothesis was correct — it's evidence that the interviews weren't open enough.

:::tip[The acid test]
If you can't explain what changed in your understanding of the problem between day one and the day you wrote the Problem Statement, the discovery didn't fulfill its function. The discomfort of discovering you were wrong is the most reliable signal that the process worked.
