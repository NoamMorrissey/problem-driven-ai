# The cognitive biases that sabotage discovery

No team enters discovery with a blank mind. We all carry an invisible baggage of biases that distort what we see, what we ask, and what we interpret. Ignoring these biases doesn't eliminate them. It makes them more dangerous. The only defense is to know them, make them explicit, and design the process to actively counteract them.

These are the most common biases in Problem Phase and the antidotes we apply:

## Confirmation bias

**What it is:** The tendency to seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms what we already believe. It's the most powerful bias and the hardest to counteract because it operates unconsciously.

**How it appears in discovery:** The team selects interviewees who will confirm their hypothesis. Questions are formulated to get the expected answer. Contradictory data is discarded as "exceptions" or "edge cases."

:::tip Antidote — The Inverted Hypothesis
Before each interview, the team explicitly writes the opposite hypothesis to what it believes. If you believe "users need more data," formulate "users have too much data and don't know what to do with it." Then design at least two questions that seek evidence for that inverted hypothesis. If you find no contrary evidence in 5 interviews, it's a legitimate finding. If you find some, it's a signal that deserves investigation.

## Anchoring bias

**What it is:** The tendency to give disproportionate weight to the first information we receive. The first interview, the first data point, the first opinion becomes the "anchor" that conditions all subsequent interpretation.

**How it appears in discovery:** The first person interviewed defines the problem narrative. Subsequent interviews are interpreted through the lens of the first. Patterns are "discovered" where the first interviewee suggested them.

:::tip Antidote — Delayed Synthesis
Don't interpret anything until you've completed all interviews. The team takes literal notes during interviews, without drawing conclusions. The synthesis is done afterwards, with all data on the table, not cumulatively. If the first interview says "A" and the third says "B," both carry equal weight in the synthesis.

## Authority bias

**What it is:** The tendency to give more credibility to information coming from people with higher hierarchy or perceived status.

**How it appears in discovery:** If a director says the problem is X, the team treats that opinion as fact. Frontline users who contradict the director are "the ones who don't see the full picture." The Problem Statement ends up reflecting the perspective of whoever has the most power, not whoever knows the most about the problem.

:::tip Antidote — Anonymized findings
During synthesis, findings are placed on the Synthesis Board without attribution. It doesn't matter who said what. What matters is what was said and how many times it appears from independent sources. A pattern emerging from three frontline users is stronger than a single executive's assertion.
:::

## Availability bias

**What it is:** The tendency to give more importance to information we remember easily, typically because it's recent, emotional, or vivid.

**How it appears in discovery:** The most emotional interview or the most dramatic story dominates the synthesis, even though it represents an extreme case. The problem gets defined around the most memorable experience, not the most representative one.

:::tip Antidote — Frequency before intensity
When analyzing findings, the team starts with frequency ("how many people mentioned this?") before intensity ("how much pain did this person express?"). A moderate problem that affects all interviewees is more significant than a severe problem that affects only one.
:::

## Framing effect

**What it is:** The way information is presented changes how we interpret it. The same fact, expressed differently, produces different conclusions.

**How it appears in discovery:** How the research question is framed conditions what is found. "Why does our inventory system fail?" and "How do managers handle inventory information?" are questions about the same topic that produce radically different findings. The first presupposes a failure. The second explores a reality.

:::tip Antidote — Triple reframing
Before starting discovery, the team formulates the research question in three different ways with different frames: one from the symptom, one from the behavior, and one from the impact. All three are used during interviews to prevent any single frame from conditioning the findings.
:::

:::tip[The principle governing all antidotes]
No antidote eliminates bias. Biases are permanent. What antidotes do is transform a process vulnerable to biases into one that makes them visible. **A team that detects its biases during discovery produces a more precise Problem Statement than a team that believes it has none.**
