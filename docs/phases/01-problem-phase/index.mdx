**What it is:** The process of understanding the real problem before thinking about solutions. It's not a kickoff meeting or a briefing. It's an active investigation with the people who live the problem. Its sole objective is to produce a problem definition that is precise, shared, and validated.

**Who participates:** The team responsible for the product or solution, direct clients or users, and any stakeholder with direct contact with the problem. In this phase, no one participates whose only relationship with the problem is organizational or hierarchical.

**What questions are answered:** What is the real problem, not the symptom? Who does it affect and how do they experience it? What causes it? What has this person already tried to solve it and why didn't it work? What is the cost of the problem if it's not solved? When does it occur, how often, in what context?

**What it produces:** A Problem Statement — a clear, concise, and validated definition of the problem. No more than half a page. It must be readable by anyone in the organization and produce the same understanding in everyone.

**When it's complete:** When the Problem Statement has been validated directly with the clients or users who live the problem and there is agreement within the team on its formulation. Not before.
