There's a scene that repeats in nearly every organization we've encountered. Someone walks into a meeting with an idea. The idea sounds good. Someone with authority says it seems interesting. Within days, there's a team assigned, a backlog created, and a sprint planned. Nobody stopped to ask whether the problem that idea was supposed to solve actually existed, or whether it existed in the way it was assumed.

With the arrival of generative AI, this dynamic has accelerated. Now you can have a working prototype in hours. An MVP in days. The temptation to jump straight to building is stronger than ever, because the perceived cost of building has plummeted. But the cost of building the wrong thing remains exactly the same. Or worse: now you produce the wrong solution faster, with a higher level of polish, and therefore with greater difficulty for anyone to dare question whether it actually solves anything.

Problem Phase exists to interrupt that pattern. It's the phase where the team forces itself to understand the real problem before thinking about solutions. It's not a kickoff meeting. It's not a briefing. It's not a form someone fills out to check a box. It's an active, rigorous, and often uncomfortable investigation with the people who live the problem every day.

Its sole objective is to produce a problem definition that is **precise, shared, and validated.** Nothing more. And nothing less.

:::tip Principle 01: The problem is sacred
**The problem is sacred.** Never assume you understand the problem. The real problem is rarely the problem presented to you in the first conversation. You have to earn it through active listening, observation, and uncomfortable questions. A misunderstood problem contaminates everything that follows, without exception.

This phase is the most counterintuitive in the entire methodology. In a world that rewards speed, asking the team to stop and think before acting seems like a luxury. It isn't. It's the highest-return investment in the entire process. Every hour invested in properly understanding the problem saves weeks of misguided building, rework cycles, realignment meetings, and above all, the erosion of trust that occurs when a team delivers something nobody needed.
