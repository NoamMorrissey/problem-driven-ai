# What Solution Alignment is and what it isn't

## What it IS

- **An iterative process, not an event.** It's not a meeting. It's not a one-day workshop. It's a cycle of theorizing, presenting, incorporating feedback, and refining that may take several rounds.
- **An alignment exercise, not a selection exercise.** It's not just about choosing the best solution. It's about ensuring all relevant people understand and support the chosen solution, including the decisions that were made and those that were discarded.
- **A process of documenting assumptions.** Every solution is based on assumptions. Unverified assumptions are risk. This process makes them explicit and classifies them by risk.
- **Preparation for AI to work.** This phase produces the input that will feed Phase 3 (Context Engineering). The quality of the solution defined here directly determines the quality of the context that will be built for the AI.

## What it is NOT

- **It's not hierarchical approval.** A director who says "go ahead" without understanding the solution is not consensus. It's permission. They are different things that produce different results when the first difficulty arrives.
- **It's not an idea contest.** The most creative idea or the loudest voice doesn't win. The one that solves the problem with the greatest precision and least friction wins, evaluated against explicit criteria.
- **It's not technical design.** In this phase, no code is written, no frameworks are chosen, no infrastructure is configured. The solution is considered at a conceptual level. Technical depth comes later.
- **It's not political negotiation.** If the solution is diluted so everyone is happy instead of being precise, this phase has failed.

:::tip[The distinction that changes everything]
The most common confusion is treating Solution Alignment as an approval. An approval is a moment. An alignment is a process. **The value isn't in someone saying "yes" — it's in everyone who said "yes" understanding exactly what they said yes to.** When the first difficulty arrives, the difference between permission and alignment determines whether the team fragments or adapts.
