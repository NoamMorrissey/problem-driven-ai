# Who participates

The group composition changes significantly from Phase 1. In Problem Discovery, the team needed to be protected from hierarchical influences. Here the opposite occurs: stakeholders who were explicitly excluded from discovery are needed for alignment.

| Participant | Role in this phase | Why they participate now |
|---|---|---|
| **Product team** | Leads the process. Presents solutions, facilitates feedback, integrates iterations. | They understand the problem most deeply after discovery. They serve as guardians of fidelity to the Problem Statement. |
| **Business stakeholders** | Evaluate economic viability, KPI impact, strategy alignment. | The business dimension of the solution needs their perspective. An ROI the technical team considers obvious may be unviable for the business. |
| **Technical stakeholders** | Evaluate technical viability, integration constraints, architectural implications. | The architecture and data dimensions need their perspective. An elegant solution that doesn't integrate with existing systems is not a solution. |
| **Design / UX** | Evaluates user experience, adoption, friction. | If the solution is technically perfect but nobody uses it, it doesn't solve the problem. |
| **Operations** | Evaluates operability, maintenance, operational scalability. | A solution that works in pilot but collapses in production is not a solution. |
| **Selected clients or users** | Validate that the proposed solution solves their real problem. | The user who validated the Problem Statement now validates that the solution makes sense to them. Their perspective prevents silent drift from the original problem. |

:::tip[Insight]
**The breadth of the group depends on the solution's impact.** An operational component affecting one team can be aligned with 5-8 people. A core transformation affecting the entire organization may require 15-20. The rule is: if someone can block the solution after it's built, they should participate in alignment before it's built.
