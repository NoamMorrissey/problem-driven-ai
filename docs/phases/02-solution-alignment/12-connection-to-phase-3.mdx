# Connection to Phase 3: Context Engineering

The Solution Brief is the entry document to Phase 3. Together with the Phase 1 Problem Statement, it contains everything the Context Engineering team needs to translate human thinking into a language AI can process.

But there's something worth noting: Phase 3 doesn't start from zero. The dimension structuring work done here is the raw material for Context Engineering. The Solution Tree becomes the PRD structure. Active assumptions become context constraints. Success criteria become the metrics AI agents must optimize.

The transition has three key moments:

**The Problem Statement travels intact.** It's not rewritten, not summarized, not "improved." It's the canonical reference for the problem. Any deviation from it during construction is context debt.

**The Solution Brief is translated, not copied.** The Context Engineer takes the Solution Brief and transforms it into documents processable by AI agents: the PRD for the PM Agent, the Architecture Document for the Architect Agent, the Story Files for the Scrum Master Agent. The four-dimension structure enormously facilitates this translation because each dimension naturally maps to an aspect of the context.

**The Translatability Map becomes a quality checklist.** The risk signals identified in the Map are the points where the Context Engineer must invest more time in precision. If a dimension was "yellow" in translatability, that dimension's context will require more iteration to reach the necessary quality.

**Context Engineering is design, not writing.** Writing context for AI is not summarizing what you know. It's making deliberate decisions about what to include, what to exclude, how to structure, and what level of precision is needed for each element. Poor context produces poor results regardless of the model you use.
