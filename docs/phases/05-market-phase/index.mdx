**What it is:** The continuous process of capturing, interpreting, and acting on market signals to keep the Context Document aligned with reality. It is not a validation phase — it is a permanent learning regime.

**Who participates:** Product Lead (signal interpretation), Context Engineer (context updates), Data Lead (measurement systems), stakeholders from Phases 1-2 (strategic reviews), support and sales representatives (qualitative signals).

**What questions it answers:** Is the Problem Statement still the most accurate description of the problem? Are the KPIs measuring what truly matters? What did the market reveal that no amount of prior discovery could have anticipated?

**What it produces:** Signal Log (market evidence), Context Update Record (change traceability), Iteration Brief (cycle-to-cycle bridge), KPI Dashboard (real-time system state), and an increasingly precise Context Document.

**When it's complete:** It doesn't end. Phase 5 is the permanent regime in which the product and its governing context live. What varies is the intensity of intervention, not the continuity of observation.
