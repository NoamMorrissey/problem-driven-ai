# What Problem Discovery is and what it isn't

Most failures in this phase don't come from doing it poorly, but from confusing it with something else.

## What it IS

- **An active investigation.** The team goes out to seek information it doesn't have. It talks to real people. Observes real behaviors. Collects data that challenges its prior assumptions.
- **A listening process, not a presentation.** The team comes to learn, not to share what it already knows. The ratio of talking to listening should be, at minimum, 20/80.
- **An exercise in precision.** The result is not a list of problems or a generic pain map. It's a single problem definition — concise, validated, and shared.
- **A collaborative effort.** One person doesn't do it. The team does. The synthesis is built together, not in an office.
- **A commitment to truth.** If the data contradicts the hypothesis you brought in, the data wins. Always.

## What it is NOT

- **It's not a kickoff meeting.** A kickoff is an administrative act. Discovery is an act of thinking.
- **It's not a client briefing.** The briefing is what the client thinks they need. Discovery is what they actually need. Often these are very different things.
- **It's not a validation process.** If you enter discovery with the answer and seek confirmation, you're not doing discovery. You're doing organized bias.
- **It's not a Design Thinking workshop.** Workshops are a possible tool within discovery, but discovery is not reducible to a workshop. It's a process that takes days or weeks, not hours.
- **It's not optional.** In this methodology, skipping discovery isn't going faster. It's building blind.

:::danger Anti-pattern: Decorative Discovery
The team conducts two interviews, confirms what it already believed, and writes a Problem Statement that appeared to be drafted before talking to anyone. The interviews were used as decoration, not as a source of truth.

**How to detect it:** If the final Problem Statement is identical to the starting hypothesis, something went wrong. A discovery that doesn't change anything you believed going in probably wasn't a discovery.
