# The artifacts of this phase

Each phase of the Problem-Driven AI methodology produces specific artifacts. They are not optional. They are the evidence that the work was done rigorously and the memory that feeds everything that follows. In Problem Discovery, the artifacts are four:

| Artifact | When it's created | What it contains | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Actor Map** | Built at the kick-off, before selecting interviewees. | Visual map of all actors surrounding the problem: who lives it, who decides, who is affected, who has tried to solve it, who has hidden information. | Ensures discovery isn't limited to the most obvious perspective. Prevents the Invisible Stakeholder anti-pattern. |
| **Interview Guide** | Created at the kick-off, after the Actor Map. | Open question guide, without leading questions. Includes interviewee context, opening, exploration, depth, and closing blocks. Includes at least one question that challenges the main hypothesis. | Ensures consistency across interviews without sacrificing flexibility. Allows different team members to interview at the same quality level. |
| **Synthesis Board** | Built after interviews, in the synthesis session. | Visual map of findings grouped by patterns. Includes anonymized individual findings, affinity groupings, identified tensions, outliers, confirmed and refuted hypotheses. | It's the memory of the team's thinking process. Allows returning to the data at any point and reconstructing the reasoning that led to the Problem Statement. |
| **Problem Statement** | Drafted after synthesis and validated at two levels. | Problem definition of no more than half a page with seven elements: gap, owner, success criteria, constraints, actors, temporal context, and cost of inaction. | It's the input deliverable for Phase 2 (Solution Alignment). If this document isn't precise, everything that follows is contaminated. |
