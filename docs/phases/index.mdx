**Problem-Driven AI** is a methodology that progresses through five interdependent phases. It begins with **Problem Discovery**, where the team validates that the problem is real before proposing anything. It continues with **Solution Alignment**, where genuine consensus is reached on what to build and why. **Context Engineering** translates that agreement into a precise system of Agents, Rules, and Skills that guides AI during construction. **AI Build** materializes that context into a solution traceable back to the original problem. And **Market Iteration** turns real-usage signals into continuous improvements to the context. Each phase is the precondition for the next.

Explore each phase and understand what it does, who executes it, and why it exists before the time comes to apply it.
