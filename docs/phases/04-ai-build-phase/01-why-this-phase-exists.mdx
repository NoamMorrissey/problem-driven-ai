# Why this phase exists

There comes a moment in every AI project when the team has completed the thinking. The Problem Statement is validated. The Solution Brief has organizational consensus. Agents are defined, Rules are written in the project-context.md, and Skills are documented in self-contained Story Files.

That's when the question that changes everything arrives: **what now?**

The answer is Phase 4. And the answer is, deliberately, almost disappointingly simple: now you build.

## The trap this phase deactivates

Building doesn't mean executing without thought. Building, in this methodology, means something very specific: **producing a solution that is recognizable as a faithful expression of the Problem Statement and Solution Brief by the people who produced them.**

That distinction — between building and building faithfully — is Phase 4's reason for existing.

With the arrival of generative AI, the perceived cost of construction has plummeted. A development agent can generate thousands of lines of code in minutes. It can make technical decisions, resolve dependencies, write tests. This capability is extraordinary. And it is, precisely for that reason, extraordinarily dangerous if the context guiding it is imprecise or if the human team stops supervising the fidelity of the output.

Phase 4 exists so that **AI's construction speed becomes an asset, not a risk.** Its function isn't to manage construction — it's to protect context integrity during construction.

## The dimension that complicates everything

There's a dimension of this phase that didn't appear in previous ones: **in real projects, construction doesn't happen sequentially.** It happens in parallel. Multiple developers, multiple AI agents, multiple Story Files executing simultaneously.

Imagine a team where three people ask their AI agents to implement three different modules at the same time. Each agent produces technically correct code. But naming conventions differ slightly between modules. The interfaces assume incompatible data formats. And nobody detects the incoherencies until they try to integrate everything.

This reality introduces a specific set of tensions that Phase 4 addresses as a central theme: how to coordinate distributed construction without sacrificing the speed that makes it valuable.

:::tip Principle #05
**Construction is a symptom, not a goal.** Building is the natural consequence of having thought well. It is not an achievement in itself. A team that celebrates having built quickly without validating the problem is celebrating in the wrong direction.

## If Phase 4 is hard, what failed?

If a team reaches this phase and construction feels chaotic, unpredictable, or full of decisions that weren't planned for, the problem isn't in Phase 4. It's in previous phases.

A precise Context Document turns construction into a predictable process. Difficulty isn't a sign of technical complexity — it's a sign of Context Debt accumulated in Phases 1-3.
