In previous phases, team composition organized around a central activity: discovering the problem, aligning the solution, designing the context. In Phase 4, composition organizes around a tension: **how to distribute construction among multiple people and AI agents without losing context coherence.**

## The fundamental shift

In Phase 3, the Context Engineer was the absolute protagonist — designing Agents, Rules and Skills. In Phase 4, the Context Engineer shifts to a supervision role. They no longer create — **they protect.** Their job is ensuring that what's being built remains faithful to what was designed.

The spotlight distributes across developers executing Story Files with AI agents. But that distribution is not flat. There's a functional hierarchy where each level has exactly the visibility and decision-making capacity its position justifies.

## The five levels

| Level | Role | What they do in this phase | What they can decide |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Context Engineer** | Owns the project-context.md. Has visibility into all tracks in real time. Resolves gaps affecting more than one track. | Total over Rules. Can stop any construction track. |
| 2 | **Tech Lead** | Supervises technical coherence between tracks. Detects decision collisions between teams. First escalation line for integration issues. | Can pause a track. Cannot modify Rules without the Context Engineer. |
| 3 | **Track Dev Leads** | Lead execution of their Story File group. Maintain the track's Decision Log. Escalate to Tech Lead when a local decision may affect another track. | Decisions local to the track. Cannot make integration decisions. |
| 4 | **Developers** | Execute Story Files with AI agents under Dev Lead supervision. Document gaps in real time. | Only within the active Story File. Do not make unplanned technical decisions without documenting them. |
| 5 | **QA Agent** | Validates each Story File output before it moves to "completed." Detects Rule violations. Flags outputs that could collide with other tracks. | Can block a Story File. Cannot approve Rule changes. |

:::tip The hierarchy's logic
A developer who can't see the neighboring track should not make decisions that affect it. A Context Engineer who sees all tracks is the only one who can make cross-cutting decisions. Each level has access to exactly the information it needs and exactly the decision-making capacity its visibility justifies.

## Roles returning from previous phases

Stakeholders from Phases 1 and 2 don't participate in daily construction. But they return at two critical moments:

**During Partial Fidelity Reviews** — every 3-4 completed Stories, the Context Engineer presents the integrated project state. Stakeholders assess whether what's being built remains recognizable as a response to the problem they defined.

**During the Final Fidelity Review** — upon completing construction, stakeholders sign the Build Validation Report. Their question isn't "Is the code good?" but "Does this solve the problem we described?"

## In small projects

Not every project needs five levels. In a 1-2 person team with sequential construction:

- The **Context Engineer** and **Tech Lead** are the same person
- There are no **Track Dev Leads** because there are no parallel tracks
- The **developer** executes Story Files sequentially and maintains a simple Decision Log
- The **QA Agent** remains mandatory — it's the validation that protects fidelity

The hierarchy simplifies, but the supervision (Context Engineer) and validation (QA Agent) roles never disappear. Without them, construction loses its anchor to context.
