When the Build Validation Report is signed, the team has something that very few organizations produce: **a built solution that is documentally traced back to the problem it's meant to solve.** Every line of code has a Story File. Every Story File has a use case in the PRD. Every use case has a success criterion inherited from the Problem Statement.

## What construction produces for Phase 5

In projects with parallel construction, there's an additional element of value: the consolidated Decision Log from all tracks is an extraordinarily precise map of the assumptions that construction verified, refuted, and left open. Each cross-impact entry resolved in an integration synchronization is a learning about how the system's components interact in practice.

That knowledge — which didn't exist in Phase 3 — is the most informed input that Phase 5 can receive when it starts.

## The three transfers

There are three specific transfers between Phase 4 and Phase 5 that deserve attention:

**1. The updated Context Document is Phase 5's foundation.** The context that Phase 5 will iterate on reflects what was actually built across all tracks, with all Rules that emerged from construction and all integration learnings incorporated. It's not the idealized context from Phase 3 — it's the real context, tested against the reality of implementation.

**2. The consolidated Iteration Brief opens the conversation with the market.** The open learnings from all tracks — the decisions that couldn't be made without market data — are the first hypotheses that Phase 5 will test. These hypotheses are extraordinarily valuable because they come from having built, not from having speculated.

**3. KPIs and OKRs activate for the complete system.** Phase 5 will measure whether the market confirms or refutes the Problem Statement's assumptions about the system as a whole, not about individual components.

:::tip Principle #09: Context is a living asset
The context you build for AI is not a static document. It evolves with each iteration, with each market signal, with each new learning. Treating it as finished is the beginning of Context Debt.

## The right attitude

There's one last principle that defines the right attitude toward the end of this phase. **It's not an achievement. It's a transition.**

The team that completes Phase 4 holds a solution that doesn't yet know if it works in the real world. The Problem Phase was rigorous, the Solution Phase was deep, the Context Phase was precise, and the construction was faithful. All of that reduces the probability of failure. It doesn't eliminate it.

Phase 5 is where the market speaks its truth. And that truth, whatever it may be, is the most valuable input the Context Document can receive.

:::tip Principle #07: The market always knows more than you
No discovery, no matter how deep, replaces real market contact. The signals generated by real usage are higher quality data than any prior hypothesis. The system must be designed to listen to them and act on them.
