# 3. Context engineering

## Agents, Rules and Skills: the operating system of the AI project

> *"AI doesn't understand what you know. It understands what you tell it. And the distance between the two is where most projects are lost."*

---

**What it is:** The discipline of translating the human understanding produced in Phases 1 and 2 into a system that AI can process. It's not about writing prompts or summarizing what the team knows. It's about designing an operating system composed of three inseparable elements: Agents that orchestrate and execute, Rules that govern and constrain, and Skills that define the concrete work. Together, these three elements are the context.

**Who participates:** The Context Engineer — the architect of the Agents, Rules, and Skills system. Not a prompt engineer. Not a technical writer. A designer who works simultaneously across three dimensions: defining who does what (Agents), what's allowed and what's not (Rules), and what specific work needs to be done (Skills).

**What questions are answered:** How do we translate the Problem Statement and Solution Brief into something an AI can act on with precision? What roles does the AI need? What rules are non-negotiable? How do we decompose the solution into self-contained units of work? How do we ensure that nothing gets lost in translation?

**What it produces:** A complete context system: a project-context.md with the Rules that govern everything, Agent definitions with identity, responsibilities and limits, a PRD, an Architecture Document, and Story Files that are the Skills each Agent will execute. Plus a Decision Log that records every evolution.

**When it's complete:** When the outputs produced by Agents executing Skills under Rules are recognized by the stakeholders from Phases 1 and 2 as faithful expressions of the Problem Statement and Solution Brief. Not when the documents look good. When the results are right.

:::tip[Principle #04: Context Engineering is not documentation]
**Context Engineering is systems design.** You don't produce documents — you produce an operating system that AI will execute. The difference between a good prompt and a good context system is the same as between giving an instruction and building an organization. Instructions are forgotten. Systems operate.
