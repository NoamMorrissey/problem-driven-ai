# Phase 04: AI Build

## Build well because it was thought well

> *"The value of Context Engineering is measured in Phase 4. If the context was precise, the construction is almost boring. That's not a problem. That's the goal."*

**What it is:** The process of materializing the system of Agents, Rules and Skills into a working solution. It is not creation — it is translation from context to code.

**Who participates:** Context Engineer (context owner), Tech Lead (technical coherence), Track Dev Leads (execution), developers with AI agents (construction), QA Agent (validation).

**What questions it answers:** Is the output faithful to the Problem Statement? Do parallel tracks produce a coherent system? Are gaps discovered during construction managed without introducing Context Debt?

**What it produces:** Built and validated solution, consolidated Decision Log, Build Validation Report signed by stakeholders, updated Context Document, Iteration Brief for Phase 5.

**When it's complete:** Stakeholders from Phases 1 and 2 recognize the complete system as a faithful expression of the Problem Statement and Solution Brief.
