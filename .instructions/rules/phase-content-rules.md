# Phase Content Rules — Problem-Driven AI

## Content Quality Rules

These rules apply to ALL phase content (methodology + framework).
They complement `core-rules.md`.

---

### Rule 10: AI-Applied Examples

- **Applies to**: All phase and framework pages
- **Requirement**: Examples MUST use AI-applied scenarios, not generic
  software examples
- **Good**: "When a team prompts an LLM to generate an API without
  first defining the problem, the output looks professional but solves
  the wrong need"
- **Bad**: "When a team starts coding without requirements, they waste time"
- **Violation**: WARN. Request AI-specific example from user or rewrite.

---

### Rule 11: Framework Audience Accessibility

- **Applies to**: All framework pages (`framework/phases/`)
- **Requirement**: Technical concepts MUST be explained for a mixed
  audience (designers, developers, business, strategy). No jargon
  without inline explanation.
- **Test**: A designer with no engineering background should understand
  the purpose (not implementation) of every concept.
- **Format**: When introducing a technical term, provide a one-sentence
  plain-language explanation inline or in a `:::tip` block.
- **Violation**: WARN. Request clarification or add explanation.

---

### Rule 12: Methodology Page Structure

- **Applies to**: Methodology phase pages (`phases/[NN]-[name]/`)
- **Standard pages** (must exist for every phase):
  1. `index.mdx` — Overview with DocCardList
  2. "Why this phase exists" — Motivation page
  3. "Who participates and when" — Roles page
  4. "Connection to Phase N+1" — Bridge page
- **Phase-specific pages**: Determined by content. Minimum 2, no maximum.
- **Violation**: WARN if standard pages are missing.

---

### Rule 13: Framework Page Structure

- **Applies to**: Framework phase pages (`framework/phases/[NN]-[name]/`)
- **Required pages** (identical structure for every phase):
  1. `index.mdx` — Overview with DocCardList (sidebar_position: 0)
  2. Step by Step (sidebar_position: 1)
  3. Anatomy (sidebar_position: 2)
  4. Artifacts (sidebar_position: 3)
  5. Gate Review (sidebar_position: 4)
  6. Anti-patterns (sidebar_position: 5)
  7. Duration (sidebar_position: 6)
- **Sidebar labels MUST match** existing phases exactly (EN and ES)
- **Violation**: BLOCK if any of the 6 pages is missing.

---

### Rule 14: Content Length Guidelines

- **Applies to**: All phase and framework pages
- **Methodology pages**: 80-150 lines. Enough depth, no padding.
- **Framework pages**: 100-250 lines. More detailed, includes templates
  and tables.
- **Index pages**: 30-60 lines. Overview + DocCardList.
- **Violation**: WARN if outside range. May be acceptable with justification.

---

### Rule 15: Human Review Gate

- **Applies to**: All content generated by `construir fase`
- **Requirement**: NO content is committed without explicit human approval
- **Workflow**: Generate → Build + Serve preview → Present → Human reviews →
  APPROVE (commit) or REJECT (iterate with feedback)
- **Violation**: BLOCK. Never auto-commit generated content.

---

### Rule 16: Preview Before Review

- **Applies to**: All content generated by `construir fase`
- **Requirement**: Before presenting content for human review, the site
  MUST be built and served locally so the reviewer can navigate the
  content in-browser.
- **Process**:
  1. Kill any existing server: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
  2. Clean and build: `npx docusaurus clear && npx docusaurus build`
  3. Serve: `npx docusaurus serve --port 3000 &`
  4. Confirm 200 on new pages before presenting for review
- **Violation**: WARN. Content review without visual preview leads to
  missed formatting issues and broken layouts.
